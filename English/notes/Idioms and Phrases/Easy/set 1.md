## 1. behind the smoke screen
The phrase **"behind the smoke screen"** refers to an action or situation used to hide the truth or to cover up real intentions. It means creating a distraction or a false appearance to conceal what is actually happening. A "smoke screen" originally refers to a military tactic where smoke is used to obscure movement, but in this figurative sense, it’s about deliberately misleading others.

For example:
- "The company’s promises of a price cut were just a smoke screen to distract from their declining quality."

**Mind Palace technique to remember:**
Picture a literal **"smoke screen"** like a cloud of smoke, blocking your view. Behind it, something else is happening, but you can’t see clearly because you are being misled or distracted. Apply this to situations where people create confusion or false narratives to hide their true actions.
