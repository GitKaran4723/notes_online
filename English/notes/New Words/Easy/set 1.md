## 1. Apprehended

The term **"apprehended"** has a few related meanings, primarily focusing on the idea of capture or understanding:

1. **Arrest or Detain**: In legal or law enforcement contexts, "apprehended" typically means that someone has been caught or arrested by authorities.
   - Example: "The police apprehended the suspect after a long chase."

2. **Understand**: In a broader, more abstract sense, "apprehended" can mean to understand or grasp something mentally.

In both senses, it refers to a form of **taking hold**—either physically or mentally.

## 2. fortnight

A **fortnight** refers to a period of **two weeks** or **14 days**. The term comes from the Old English phrase *"feowertyne niht,"* meaning **fourteen nights**. It is commonly used in British English and some other Commonwealth countries but is less common in American English, where "two weeks" is typically used instead.

### Example:
- "The project will be completed in a **fortnight**," meaning the project will be finished in 14 days.


## 3. stench 
The word **"stench"** refers to a strong, unpleasant, and typically offensive smell. It is often used to describe odors that are particularly foul or noxious, such as the smell of decay, waste, or rotting matter.

### Example:
- "The **stench** of garbage filled the air as we passed by the landfill."

### Synonyms:
- **Odor**
- **Smell**
- **Funk**
- **Reek**
- **Miasma**

While "stench" always conveys a negative connotation, its synonyms like "odor" or "smell" can be neutral depending on the context.

## 4. vindictive
The term **"vindictive"** refers to a strong desire for revenge or to harm someone who has wronged you. It describes someone who is unforgiving and seeks retribution, often out of spite or malice.

In simple terms, if a person is **vindictive**, they are likely to hold grudges and want to get back at others for any perceived wrongs.

For example:
- "His vindictive nature made him plot against those who had slighted him."
  
**Mind Palace technique to remember:**
Imagine **"vindictive"** as someone with a strong **"win"** or **"victory"** desire in a **negative** way, fueled by revenge. Just picture someone going overboard to make sure they "win" after being hurt, like seeking payback at all costs.

## 5. adjourned
The term **"adjourned"** means to suspend or temporarily pause a meeting, session, or legal proceeding, with the intention of resuming it at a later time or date. It signifies a break or postponement, often used in formal settings like courts or legislative assemblies.

For example:
- "The court was adjourned until the following day."
  
**Mind Palace technique to remember:**
Imagine a meeting or a session is like a **journey** (sounds like "adjourn"). When it’s **adjourned**, the journey is paused and will be continued later, just like when you take a break and then return to finish a trip.


## 6. charge sheet
A **charge sheet** is a formal document prepared by law enforcement agencies that lists the criminal charges or allegations made against an individual or group. It is typically filed in a court of law after an investigation and is a key step in initiating a criminal prosecution. The charge sheet contains details of the offense, the evidence gathered, and the individuals accused.

For example:
- "The police filed a charge sheet against the accused after completing the investigation."

**Mind Palace technique to remember:**
Visualize a **"sheet"** where all **"charges"** (allegations) are written down by the authorities. Just like writing a list of complaints, this sheet formally states what someone is accused of, making it official in the eyes of the law.



## 7. gutted
The term **"gutted"** has two primary meanings, depending on the context:

1. **Literal Meaning**:
   - In its literal sense, **"gutted"** refers to the removal of the internal organs or contents of something, often used in relation to animals (like fish) or buildings.
   - Example: "The fish was gutted before cooking."
   - Or, for buildings: "The old house was gutted by fire."

2. **Informal/Emotional Meaning**:
   - In informal British English, **"gutted"** is used to describe someone who is extremely disappointed or upset.
   - Example: "He was gutted when his team lost the final match."

**Mind Palace technique to remember:**
Picture the word **"gutted"** like having the inside of something removed or destroyed, leaving a hollow feeling. In the emotional sense, it’s like having your heart emptied because you’re deeply disappointed or hurt, just as if something important was taken away from you.
