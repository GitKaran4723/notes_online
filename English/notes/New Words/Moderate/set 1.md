## 1. Drudgery 
**Drudgery** refers to dull, repetitive, and often physically or mentally exhausting work that is tedious and lacks any sense of enjoyment. It typically describes tasks that are monotonous and require a lot of effort but offer little satisfaction or reward.

For example:
- "He spent the entire day in the drudgery of filing paperwork."

**Mind Palace technique to remember:**
Imagine a **"drudge"**, which sounds like someone trudging through muddy ground, slowly and painfully. **Drudgery** is like being stuck in endless, boring work, just like trudging through a tiring and unpleasant task with no excitement.


## 2. Excrement 
**Excrement** refers to waste matter discharged from the body, particularly feces or stool. It is the solid waste that is eliminated from the digestive system through the process of defecation.

For example:
- "The excrement of animals is often used as fertilizer."

**Mind Palace technique to remember:**
Think of **"excrement"** as something that is **"exited"** from the body, like waste being removed. Just like an exit door allows something to leave, **excrement** is what the body gets rid of after digestion.
