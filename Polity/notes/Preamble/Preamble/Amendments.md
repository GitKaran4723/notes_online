The **Preamble to the Constitution of India** has been amended **only once**. This amendment took place in **1976** during the **Emergency**, through the **42nd Amendment Act**. The amendment made three key changes to the original text of the Preamble:

1. The word **"Socialist"** was added.
2. The word **"Secular"** was added.
3. The phrase **"Unity of the Nation"** was changed to **"Unity and Integrity of the Nation."**

### Pre-42nd Amendment Preamble:
- **WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC...**

### Post-42nd Amendment Preamble:
- **WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLIC...**

Thus, the 42nd Amendment reflected changes in India's political and social landscape, particularly underlining its secular and socialist orientation.
