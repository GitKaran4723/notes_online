# Military and Strategic Cooperation and Competition

### **5. Military and Strategic Cooperation and Competition between India and China**

Military and strategic relations between India and China are characterized by both cooperation and competition. As two of the largest and most powerful nations in Asia, their military dynamics are heavily influenced by border disputes, regional security concerns, and broader geopolitical rivalries. While the two nations have engaged in military dialogues and exercises in the past, their strategic competition, particularly in the border areas and the Indian Ocean region, remains a central focus of their defense policies.

#### **1. Border Security and Military Standoffs**
   - **LAC and Military Buildup**: The lack of a clearly defined border, known as the **Line of Actual Control (LAC)**, has led to frequent military standoffs and skirmishes. Both countries have deployed large numbers of troops along the LAC, particularly in sensitive areas like **Ladakh (Aksai Chin)** and **Arunachal Pradesh**. Periodic clashes, such as the **Doklam standoff in 2017** and the **Galwan Valley clash in 2020**, have significantly strained relations.
   - **Galwan Valley Clash (2020)**: The Galwan Valley incident was a major flashpoint in India-China military relations. It resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers, marking the first deadly clash between the two nations in decades. This incident prompted India to re-evaluate its military posture and led to an increased focus on securing its northern borders.
   - **Military Infrastructure Development**: Both countries have been investing heavily in military infrastructure along the LAC. India has accelerated the construction of roads, airstrips, and military bases near the border to improve logistics and troop mobility. China, on the other hand, has been developing high-altitude military bases and infrastructure to strengthen its strategic positions in Tibet and Xinjiang.

#### **2. Military Modernization and Strategic Capabilities**
   - **China’s Military Modernization**: The **People’s Liberation Army (PLA)** has undergone significant modernization in recent years. China has invested heavily in building a technologically advanced military, including a modern air force, a large navy, and sophisticated missile systems. China’s defense budget is the second-largest in the world, and its military capabilities are focused on power projection not just in Asia, but globally.
   - **India’s Military Modernization**: In response to the growing military capabilities of China, India has also been modernizing its armed forces. India has focused on upgrading its **air force**, expanding its **naval capabilities**, and enhancing its **missile and space-based defense systems**. Key defense purchases, such as the **Rafale fighter jets** from France and **S-400 missile defense systems** from Russia, are aimed at boosting India’s deterrence capabilities against China.
   - **Nuclear Deterrence**: Both India and China are nuclear-armed states, and their strategic competition includes maintaining credible nuclear deterrence. India follows a **no-first-use (NFU)** policy, while China also claims to follow an NFU doctrine. However, the development of sophisticated missile systems, such as India’s **Agni series** of ballistic missiles and China’s **DF-21** and **DF-26** missiles, has heightened the nuclear rivalry between the two countries.

#### **3. Strategic Competition in the Indian Ocean**
   - **India’s Dominance in the Indian Ocean**: The **Indian Ocean** is a key strategic area for India, which sees itself as the dominant power in the region. The Indian Navy plays a crucial role in safeguarding sea lanes, ensuring maritime security, and protecting India's interests in the region. India’s naval modernization includes the acquisition of **aircraft carriers**, **submarines**, and **warships** to project power and maintain a strategic edge in the Indian Ocean.
   - **China’s Naval Expansion**: China has been expanding its naval presence in the Indian Ocean through its **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)** projects, such as the development of **Gwadar Port** in Pakistan and **Hambantota Port** in Sri Lanka. China has also established its first overseas military base in **Djibouti**, near the strategic choke point of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. These developments have raised concerns in India about China’s growing influence and potential encirclement strategy, often referred to as the **"String of Pearls"**.
   - **Malabar Naval Exercises**: India has been working closely with its strategic partners, particularly the **United States**, **Japan**, and **Australia**, to counter China’s presence in the Indian Ocean. The **Malabar naval exercises**, which originally involved only India and the US, have expanded to include Japan and Australia, focusing on enhancing maritime cooperation and readiness in the Indo-Pacific.

#### **4. Defense Cooperation and Alliances**
   - **India’s Strategic Partnerships**: To counterbalance China’s growing influence, India has strengthened its defense partnerships with key nations. The **United States** is a major defense partner for India, with agreements such as the **Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA)** and the **Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA)** enabling closer military cooperation and intelligence sharing. India also engages in joint military exercises with countries like **Japan**, **France**, **Australia**, and **Russia**.
   - **The Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue)**: India’s participation in the **Quad**—alongside the US, Japan, and Australia—is a significant aspect of its strategic efforts to counter China. The Quad focuses on ensuring a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific, with a particular emphasis on maritime security and countering China’s growing military presence in the region.
   - **China’s Strategic Cooperation with Pakistan**: China’s military and strategic partnership with Pakistan is a key concern for India. China has supplied Pakistan with advanced military equipment, including fighter jets, naval vessels, and missile technology. This partnership strengthens Pakistan’s defense capabilities, particularly against India, and also provides China with a strategic foothold in South Asia.

#### **5. Diplomatic and Military Dialogues**
   - **Military Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs)**: Despite their strategic rivalry, India and China have engaged in several **confidence-building measures (CBMs)** to prevent military conflicts along the LAC. These include agreements on disengagement, joint military patrols, and hotlines between military commanders to manage border tensions. However, these CBMs have often been undermined by incidents of military standoffs and skirmishes.
   - **Annual Military Dialogues**: India and China hold regular **defense and security dialogues** to discuss border security, military cooperation, and regional stability. These dialogues are intended to reduce misunderstandings and prevent the escalation of military tensions. However, progress has been limited, particularly after the 2020 Galwan clash.
   - **De-escalation Talks**: Since the Galwan Valley incident, both countries have held multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions along the LAC. These talks have led to limited disengagement in certain areas, but a comprehensive resolution to the border dispute remains elusive.

### **Key Points to Remember**:
   - **Border tensions** along the **LAC** remain a central issue in India-China military relations, with both nations increasing their military presence in disputed areas like **Ladakh** and **Arunachal Pradesh**.
   - Both countries are undergoing significant **military modernization**, with China’s PLA focusing on global power projection, while India is enhancing its air, naval, and missile capabilities.
   - **Strategic competition in the Indian Ocean** is intensifying, with India aiming to maintain dominance and China expanding its naval presence through port development and military bases.
   - India is strengthening its **defense partnerships** with the **US**, **Japan**, **Australia**, and other nations, while China continues its strategic cooperation with **Pakistan**.
   - **Diplomatic and military dialogues** between India and China continue, but tensions remain high, particularly after the **Galwan Valley clash** in 2020.
