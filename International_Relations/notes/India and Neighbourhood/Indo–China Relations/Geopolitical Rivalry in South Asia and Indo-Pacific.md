# Geopolitical Rivalry in South Asia and Indo-Pacific

### **3. Geopolitical Rivalry in South Asia and Indo-Pacific**

The geopolitical rivalry between India and China extends beyond bilateral tensions to competition for influence in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region. Both countries are emerging global powers, and their strategic goals often intersect and conflict in these regions. While China seeks to expand its influence through economic and military means, India aims to protect its interests and maintain its leadership in South Asia.

#### **1. Strategic Rivalry in South Asia**
   - **India's Traditional Influence**: Historically, India has been the dominant power in South Asia, exerting significant influence over its neighboring countries like Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. India has long considered South Asia its sphere of influence and sees itself as the primary security provider in the region.
   - **China's Growing Influence**: In recent years, China has been making significant inroads into South Asia through investments, trade deals, and infrastructure projects, particularly under the **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**. This has led to China strengthening ties with countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, challenging India's traditional influence in the region.
   - **China-Pakistan Alliance**: The strategic alliance between China and Pakistan is a major concern for India. China has invested heavily in Pakistan through the **China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)**, which is part of the larger BRI. The CPEC runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which India claims as its territory, adding a territorial dimension to the rivalry.
   - **Competition in Other South Asian Countries**: In addition to Pakistan, China has significantly increased its presence in countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. China's investments in infrastructure projects, including ports, roads, and power plants, are seen as part of its strategy to expand influence in India's backyard, often referred to as China's "String of Pearls" strategy.

#### **2. Indo-Pacific Strategy**
   - **India's Act East Policy**: India’s **Act East Policy** focuses on strengthening ties with Southeast Asian countries and expanding its strategic footprint in the Indo-Pacific region. This policy seeks to enhance trade, defense, and cultural ties with countries like Japan, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other ASEAN members. India views the Indo-Pacific as crucial to its security and economic interests, especially in countering China’s dominance.
   - **Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue)**: India has become a key member of the **Quad**, an informal strategic grouping that includes the United States, Japan, and Australia. The Quad is seen as a counterbalance to China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific, particularly its increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. The Quad focuses on maritime security, freedom of navigation, and regional stability.
   - **China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**: China’s BRI extends to the Indo-Pacific region through projects like the Gwadar Port in Pakistan and Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. These projects provide China with strategic footholds that have both economic and military implications. India is wary of China’s efforts to create a network of ports and infrastructure that could give China control over key maritime routes in the region.

#### **3. Maritime Competition in the Indian Ocean**
   - **India’s Role in the Indian Ocean**: The Indian Ocean is of vital importance to India, as it controls key sea lanes that facilitate global trade and energy shipments. India has traditionally seen itself as the dominant naval power in the region and has invested heavily in developing its naval capabilities.
   - **China’s Expanding Presence**: China has increasingly sought to expand its presence in the Indian Ocean through port development projects and naval deployments. China's acquisition of ports like Hambantota in Sri Lanka and Gwadar in Pakistan, along with its military presence in Djibouti, has raised concerns in India about Chinese encirclement. China’s growing naval footprint is viewed as part of its broader “String of Pearls” strategy aimed at securing sea routes and expanding its influence.
   - **Naval Modernization**: Both India and China are modernizing their naval forces to strengthen their positions in the Indian Ocean. India has focused on acquiring new aircraft carriers, submarines, and warships to maintain its naval dominance. Meanwhile, China’s naval modernization includes building aircraft carriers and expanding its submarine fleet, giving it the ability to project power in the region.

#### **4. Strategic Infrastructure and Influence in Neighboring Countries**
   - **China’s Infrastructure Projects**: Through the Belt and Road Initiative, China has financed and built infrastructure projects in South Asia, such as roads, railways, and ports. These projects give China leverage over smaller South Asian nations by increasing their economic dependence on Chinese loans and investments.
   - **Debt Trap Diplomacy**: Critics argue that China uses "debt trap diplomacy" by extending loans to smaller countries for infrastructure projects that may not be economically viable. If the countries are unable to repay the loans, they risk ceding control of strategic assets to China. The case of Sri Lanka leasing the Hambantota Port to China for 99 years after defaulting on its loans is often cited as an example.
   - **India’s Response with Development Projects**: In response to China’s infrastructure diplomacy, India has increased its own investments in South Asia. India has provided development assistance and loans to neighboring countries to counter China’s influence. Projects like the **Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project** and the development of the **Chabahar Port** in Iran are part of India’s strategy to enhance regional connectivity and reduce dependence on China.

#### **5. Military and Strategic Partnerships**
   - **India's Defense Partnerships**: To counter China’s rising influence, India has deepened its defense and strategic partnerships with key countries. This includes signing defense agreements and conducting joint military exercises with the United States, Japan, Australia, and other countries in the Indo-Pacific region. India’s growing ties with Japan and Australia, in particular, are seen as efforts to form a strategic counterbalance to China’s presence in the region.
   - **US-India Defense Cooperation**: The defense partnership between India and the United States has grown significantly, particularly through agreements like the **Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA)**, which allows the two countries to use each other's military bases for logistical support. The **2+2 Ministerial Dialogue** between India and the US further strengthens defense cooperation, with an emphasis on maritime security and defense technology sharing.
   - **China’s Military Alliances**: While China does not have formal military alliances in South Asia, its deep defense cooperation with Pakistan serves as a strategic counterweight to India. China has provided Pakistan with military technology, including aircraft and missiles, and has supported the development of Pakistan’s nuclear program. This military partnership is seen as a way for China to maintain influence in South Asia and keep India in check.

### **Key Points to Remember**:
   - India and China are engaged in a **geopolitical rivalry** in **South Asia** and the **Indo-Pacific** region, with both seeking to expand their influence.
   - **China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)** has allowed China to build infrastructure projects in South Asia, challenging India's traditional dominance in the region.
   - India is part of the **Quad**, along with the US, Japan, and Australia, aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific.
   - **Maritime competition in the Indian Ocean** is intensifying, with India working to maintain its naval dominance while China expands its presence through ports and military bases.
   - Both countries are strengthening their **military partnerships** and strategic alliances with other powers, with India deepening ties with the US, Japan, and Australia, while China supports Pakistan strategically and militarily.
