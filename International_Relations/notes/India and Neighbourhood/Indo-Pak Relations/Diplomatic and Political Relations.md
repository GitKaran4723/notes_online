### **Diplomatic and Political Relations between India and Pakistan**

The diplomatic and political relations between **India and Pakistan** have been marked by periods of intense hostility, failed peace initiatives, and efforts to resume dialogue. The legacy of partition, territorial disputes, especially over Jammu and Kashmir, and cross-border terrorism have shaped the trajectory of bilateral relations. Despite these challenges, both countries have made periodic attempts to normalize relations through dialogue, confidence-building measures (CBMs), and diplomatic engagements.

### **Early Diplomatic Engagements**
After the partition of British India in 1947, India and Pakistan were immediately embroiled in the first war over Jammu and Kashmir (1947-48). Despite the establishment of diplomatic missions in each other's capitals, the conflict set the tone for relations for the coming decades. The **United Nations (UN)** played a mediating role, leading to a ceasefire and the establishment of the **Line of Control (LoC)** in Kashmir, but the territorial issue remained unresolved.

### **Wars and Tensions**
The **1965 war** was another major conflict triggered by Pakistan’s attempt to alter the status of Jammu and Kashmir. The war ended with the **Tashkent Agreement** brokered by the Soviet Union, where both countries agreed to restore the pre-conflict positions without addressing the root causes of the conflict.

In **1971**, the diplomatic fallout between the two nations escalated during the Bangladesh Liberation War, leading to the creation of Bangladesh from what was East Pakistan. India’s decisive military victory in the **1971 war** significantly strained relations. The **Shimla Agreement** was signed in 1972, in which both countries committed to resolving disputes bilaterally and respecting the LoC as a de facto border in Kashmir. However, the core disputes remained unresolved.

### **Composite Dialogue Process (1997-2008)**
A significant attempt to normalize relations began in **1997** with the initiation of the **Composite Dialogue Process**, which covered a wide range of issues, including:
- Peace and security, including **confidence-building measures (CBMs)**.
- **Jammu and Kashmir** dispute.
- **Terrorism** and drug trafficking.
- **Siachen**, **Sir Creek**, and **Wullar Barrage** disputes.
- Trade and economic cooperation.
- People-to-people exchanges and cross-border movement.

This dialogue, however, was interrupted by the **Kargil conflict (1999)** when Pakistan-backed infiltrators crossed the LoC, leading to a limited war. Diplomatically, this period witnessed efforts to revive relations through initiatives such as the **Lahore Declaration (1999)**, where both sides committed to the peaceful resolution of issues, including Kashmir. However, the Kargil conflict nullified these efforts.

### **Post-2001 Diplomatic Challenges**
India’s diplomatic stance hardened after the **2001 Indian Parliament attack**, which was carried out by Pakistan-based terror groups. This led to a massive military mobilization by India and Pakistan in what became known as **Operation Parakram**. Diplomatic ties deteriorated, and high-level talks stalled.

In 2004, efforts were made to revive diplomatic engagement, and the **Composite Dialogue Process** resumed, resulting in several confidence-building measures (CBMs), including:
- Opening up the LoC for **trade** and **civilian movement**.
- **Bus services** between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad and other routes across the LoC.
- Visa relaxations and people-to-people contacts.
- **Cultural exchanges** and sports diplomacy.

### **Mumbai Attacks and Breakdown of Dialogue**
The **2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks** marked another low point in India-Pakistan relations. India directly accused Pakistan-based groups, specifically **Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)**, of orchestrating the attacks, which killed over 160 people. This led to a significant freeze in diplomatic ties, with India demanding Pakistan take action against the perpetrators. Although Pakistan detained some suspects, the slow judicial process and perceived inaction by Pakistan created deep mistrust.

The **Mumbai attacks** brought a halt to the **Composite Dialogue** once again, and India adopted a more cautious approach to any engagement with Pakistan. Diplomatic initiatives were largely focused on counterterrorism cooperation, but Pakistan’s failure to take credible action against the masterminds of the Mumbai attacks hampered any meaningful dialogue.

### **Current Diplomatic Relations (Post-2016)**
India’s diplomatic relations with Pakistan have worsened since 2016 due to increased cross-border terrorism and the lack of substantive action by Pakistan against terrorist organizations operating from its soil. Some key events during this period include:
- **Uri Attack (2016)**: Militants attacked an Indian Army camp in Uri, Jammu & Kashmir, killing 19 soldiers. In response, India carried out **surgical strikes** on terrorist launch pads across the LoC in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Diplomatic relations further soured, with India opting for a more aggressive approach to counter terrorism.
- **Pulwama Attack (2019)**: A suicide bombing in Pulwama by a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist killed 40 Indian security personnel. India retaliated by conducting **airstrikes** on a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in **Balakot**, Pakistan. This marked the first instance of airstrikes across the international border since the 1971 war, escalating tensions between the two countries.

In the aftermath of Pulwama and Balakot, Pakistan responded by expelling the Indian High Commissioner, suspending bilateral trade, and halting bus and train services between the two nations. India, in turn, revoked Pakistan’s **Most Favoured Nation (MFN)** status and increased customs duties on Pakistani imports to 200%.

### **Article 370 Revocation and Diplomatic Fallout (2019)**
A significant diplomatic event occurred in **August 2019** when India revoked **Article 370** of its Constitution, stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and bifurcating the state into two Union Territories—**Jammu and Kashmir** and **Ladakh**. Pakistan strongly condemned this move, claiming it violated UN resolutions and the bilateral status quo on Kashmir.

In retaliation, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties, expelled India’s High Commissioner, and launched an international campaign to garner support against India’s actions in Kashmir. Despite Pakistan’s efforts, the global community largely viewed the issue as an internal matter for India, and Pakistan failed to gain substantial support for its stance at the United Nations.

### **2021 Ceasefire Agreement**
A positive diplomatic development occurred in **February 2021**, when both India and Pakistan agreed to observe the **2003 ceasefire agreement** along the **Line of Control (LoC)**. This ceasefire brought temporary relief from the regular skirmishes that had escalated in recent years. It also opened avenues for backchannel diplomacy between the two nations.

Despite the ceasefire, core issues such as **Kashmir**, **cross-border terrorism**, and the overall lack of trust continue to impede any long-term diplomatic engagement.

### **International and Regional Diplomacy**
Pakistan has often sought third-party mediation in its disputes with India, particularly in forums like the **United Nations**, **Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)**, and through countries like the **United States** and **China**. India, however, maintains that all issues, particularly Kashmir, must be resolved bilaterally in accordance with the **Shimla Agreement (1972)** and has consistently rejected third-party mediation.

Additionally, **regional organizations** like the **South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)** have been paralyzed due to Indo-Pak tensions. India has opposed Pakistan’s sponsorship of terrorism and has insisted on Pakistan taking concrete steps to combat terrorism before it can engage in meaningful dialogue. This has resulted in the **SAARC Summit** being postponed repeatedly, as India has refused to participate in meetings hosted by Pakistan.

### **Challenges in Diplomatic Relations**
- **Trust Deficit**: Years of conflict, terrorism, and failed peace initiatives have created a deep trust deficit between the two nations. This prevents meaningful diplomatic engagement.
- **Cross-Border Terrorism**: India views cross-border terrorism as a state policy of Pakistan. Until Pakistan takes verifiable action against terror groups like **Jaish-e-Mohammed** and **Lashkar-e-Taiba**, diplomatic progress remains difficult.
- **Kashmir Issue**: The Kashmir dispute remains at the heart of India-Pakistan relations, and both countries hold entrenched positions. The revocation of Article 370 further complicated diplomatic efforts.
- **Third-Party Mediation**: While Pakistan seeks international mediation, India insists on bilateral dialogue, making it difficult to find common ground.

### **Conclusion**
India and Pakistan’s diplomatic and political relations have been characterized by cycles of engagement and hostility, often dictated by security issues, especially cross-border terrorism and the Kashmir dispute. While there have been temporary efforts to improve ties, such as the ceasefire agreement in 2021, the deep-rooted mistrust, ongoing terrorism, and conflicting political interests make long-term reconciliation difficult. For meaningful progress, both nations will need to address core issues, particularly terrorism and Kashmir, through sustained dialogue and mutual confidence-building measures.
