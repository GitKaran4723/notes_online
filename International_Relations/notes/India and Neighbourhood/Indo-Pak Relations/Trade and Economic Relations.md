### **Trade and Economic Relations between India and Pakistan**

The trade and economic relationship between India and Pakistan has been highly volatile and influenced by political tensions, security concerns, and historical disputes. While there is potential for significant economic cooperation due to geographic proximity and shared cultural ties, frequent disruptions in bilateral ties—especially over issues like Kashmir and cross-border terrorism—have hindered long-term trade growth. Both countries have had sporadic economic engagements, with trade often being used as a diplomatic tool, either to build goodwill or to impose pressure.

### **Historical Context of Trade Relations**
India and Pakistan initially had strong trade ties post-partition in 1947, with Pakistan heavily dependent on Indian goods for its industrial and agricultural needs. However, the partition, coupled with the wars in 1947-48, 1965, and 1971, led to a gradual severing of these economic links.

The **Indus Waters Treaty (1960)**, which governs the use of water resources between the two nations, remains one of the few successful bilateral agreements, standing the test of multiple conflicts. However, trade in goods and services has not witnessed a similar level of resilience. The first significant step toward re-establishing economic cooperation came during the **Composite Dialogue Process (1997-2008)**, but it was interrupted by frequent political and security-related tensions.

### **Bilateral Trade Agreements**
Despite the political animosity, India and Pakistan signed several trade agreements to enhance economic cooperation:
1. **South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA, 2004)**: As members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), both countries signed SAFTA, which aimed at reducing tariffs among South Asian nations. However, the full potential of this agreement remains unrealized due to persistent bilateral tensions.
   
2. **2004 Bilateral Trade Talks**: As part of the **Composite Dialogue Process**, India and Pakistan agreed to strengthen trade relations, including liberalizing trade routes such as the **Wagah-Attari border** and allowing cross-LoC trade between parts of Jammu and Kashmir. Although these steps generated optimism, progress remained slow due to political and security concerns.

### **Trade Routes**
The two major trade routes between India and Pakistan include:
- **Land Route (Wagah-Attari border)**: This is the primary land route for trade. While it facilitates movement of goods, periodic political tensions often lead to suspensions or restrictions on this route.
- **Sea Route (Mumbai to Karachi)**: Sea trade between the two countries is facilitated via shipping routes from Indian ports like Mumbai to Karachi, Pakistan's commercial hub.

### **Major Exports and Imports**
Despite the potential for economic cooperation, bilateral trade between India and Pakistan remains limited. The main goods exchanged are often basic commodities and raw materials.

#### **India's Major Exports to Pakistan:**
- Chemicals and pharmaceuticals
- Cotton and textiles
- Tea, coffee, and spices
- Machinery and electrical equipment
- Organic chemicals
- Iron and steel

#### **Pakistan's Major Exports to India:**
- Cement
- Raw hides and skins
- Fruits (including dates)
- Surgical instruments
- Sports goods
- Cotton yarn

### **Trade Statistics**
Bilateral trade between India and Pakistan has remained low compared to other neighbors. The figures for **India-Pakistan bilateral trade** over the last six years are as follows:

| **Year**   | **India's Exports** (USD) | **Pakistan's Exports** (USD) | **Trade Balance** (USD) |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 2013-14    | $2.2 billion               | $0.43 billion               | $1.8 billion            |
| 2014-15    | $1.85 billion              | $0.50 billion               | $1.35 billion           |
| 2015-16    | $2.1 billion               | $0.44 billion               | $1.66 billion           |
| 2016-17    | $1.83 billion              | $0.46 billion               | $1.37 billion           |
| 2017-18    | $1.92 billion              | $0.49 billion               | $1.43 billion           |
| 2018-19    | $2.06 billion              | $0.50 billion               | $1.57 billion           |

### **Disruptions in Trade Relations**
Political events have had a significant impact on the economic relations between the two countries, leading to periods of complete trade suspension or increased tariffs.

#### **Post-Pulwama Tensions (2019)**
The **Pulwama terrorist attack** in February 2019, where a Pakistan-based terrorist group killed 40 Indian soldiers, was a turning point in Indo-Pak trade relations. In retaliation, India revoked Pakistan's **Most Favoured Nation (MFN)** status and imposed a **200% customs duty** on all imports from Pakistan, making Pakistani goods unaffordable in Indian markets. India had granted Pakistan MFN status in 1996 under WTO norms, but Pakistan never reciprocated.

In response to India's actions, Pakistan suspended bilateral trade with India in **August 2019**, further deteriorating the economic ties between the two nations. The decision to halt trade came in the wake of India's **revocation of Article 370** in Jammu and Kashmir, which Pakistan strongly condemned.

#### **Impact of Trade Suspension**
- **Economic Costs**: The suspension of trade hurt both economies, particularly sectors like textiles, cement, and agriculture that relied on exports across the border. For example, Pakistan’s cement industry and India’s cotton industry experienced disruptions in trade flows.
- **Increase in Informal Trade**: The suspension of formal trade has often led to an increase in **informal trade** through third-party countries like the **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**. This trade is difficult to monitor and lacks proper regulation, leading to revenue losses for both nations.

### **Potential for Economic Cooperation**
India and Pakistan have significant potential for economic cooperation if relations improve. Both nations could benefit from:
1. **Energy Trade**: Pakistan faces an energy shortage, and India, with its surplus power, could become a major energy exporter. There have been discussions about energy pipelines and electricity grids connecting the two nations, but progress has stalled due to political tensions.
   
2. **SAARC and Regional Integration**: Pakistan and India are both key members of **SAARC**. However, regional trade under SAARC remains below potential due to the bilateral tensions between the two largest members. A resolution of these issues could help reinvigorate regional economic integration.
   
3. **Cross-Border Investment**: India and Pakistan could encourage cross-border investments in sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and infrastructure. Investment in cross-LoC projects, such as tourism, could promote economic development in both countries.

4. **Trade through Wagah Border**: Strengthening and modernizing the **Wagah-Attari border** for trade can help reduce the cost of goods, particularly in sectors like textiles, chemicals, and agriculture.

### **Challenges to Trade Relations**
1. **Political Tensions**: Any progress in trade is often contingent on political goodwill, which fluctuates frequently due to issues like cross-border terrorism, Kashmir, and military conflicts.
   
2. **Cross-Border Terrorism**: India's accusations that Pakistan harbors and supports terrorist groups have significantly hindered the growth of bilateral trade. Unless Pakistan takes verifiable action against terrorism, it is unlikely that trade relations will improve.
   
3. **Trust Deficit**: A deep-rooted trust deficit between the two countries complicates any attempts at long-term economic cooperation. Economic initiatives are often viewed with suspicion and are easily disrupted by political events.

4. **Kashmir Dispute**: The Kashmir conflict remains the most significant roadblock to normalized economic relations. Until a political resolution is achieved, both countries may continue to use trade as a tool of pressure rather than cooperation.

### **Way Forward**
- **Resuming Bilateral Trade**: Resuming trade talks and normalizing economic relations will require a focus on confidence-building measures and resolving security issues. Economic engagement could serve as a starting point for improving overall diplomatic relations.
   
- **Third-Party Mediation in Trade**: International organizations like the **World Trade Organization (WTO)** and regional bodies like **SAARC** can facilitate dialogue and promote trade between the two countries, focusing on non-contentious sectors like agriculture, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.

- **Humanitarian Trade**: Even in times of tension, both countries can consider allowing the trade of essential items like medicines and agricultural products to improve the lives of civilians on both sides of the border.

### **Conclusion**
The trade and economic relationship between India and Pakistan holds immense potential, but it remains constrained by political and security-related issues. While there have been brief periods of engagement, the recurring diplomatic and military tensions have often led to trade disruptions. Addressing core political issues, particularly cross-border terrorism and the Kashmir dispute, will be essential for improving bilateral economic relations. If the two countries can build trust and foster deeper economic ties, it could pave the way for more stable diplomatic relations and contribute to broader regional stability.
