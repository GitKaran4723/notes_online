### **SAARC and Regional Cooperation in India-Pakistan Relations**

The **South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)** is a key platform for regional collaboration in South Asia, established in **1985** to promote economic, cultural, and political cooperation among its eight member states, including India and Pakistan. However, India-Pakistan tensions have largely undermined SAARC's effectiveness, hindering regional integration and cooperation.

#### **India-Pakistan Tensions in SAARC**
India and Pakistan are the largest members of SAARC, and their bilateral issues, particularly the Kashmir conflict and cross-border terrorism, have consistently impeded the organization’s progress. Major initiatives, such as improving regional connectivity, trade, and counterterrorism cooperation, have been delayed or stalled due to the strained relationship between the two countries. For instance, the **19th SAARC Summit**, scheduled to be held in Islamabad in **2016**, was canceled after India, along with other member states, boycotted it in response to the **Uri terrorist attack**, which India blamed on Pakistan-based militants.

#### **Economic and Trade Cooperation**
SAARC’s key agreements, like the **South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA)**, were designed to boost intra-regional trade, which remains one of the lowest in the world. However, India and Pakistan’s bilateral trade has suffered due to political tensions, affecting the broader goal of regional economic integration. Disruptions in trade, such as Pakistan’s decision to suspend trade with India in **2019**, after the revocation of **Article 370** in Jammu and Kashmir, further stall economic cooperation.

#### **Regional Initiatives**
While SAARC has been weakened by Indo-Pak tensions, other regional initiatives like the **Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)** and **Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)** have gained traction. India has increasingly focused on these alternatives to foster regional cooperation without Pakistan's involvement.

### **Conclusion**
SAARC’s potential as a platform for regional cooperation remains underutilized due to India-Pakistan tensions. For the organization to function effectively, both countries need to resolve their bilateral disputes or at least manage them in a way that does not disrupt regional collaboration. Until then, regional cooperation in South Asia will likely be driven by other frameworks that bypass these tensions.
