### **Role of External Powers and International Organisations in India-Pakistan Relations**

External powers and international organizations have played a critical role in shaping the dynamics of **India-Pakistan relations**, particularly in moments of heightened tension and conflict. The involvement of global actors like the **United States**, **China**, and organizations such as the **United Nations (UN)** has often been crucial in de-escalating conflicts, managing crises, and influencing bilateral diplomatic engagements.

#### **United States**
The **United States** has been an influential player in Indo-Pak relations. Historically, the US maintained close ties with Pakistan during the Cold War, using it as a strategic ally in South Asia. However, in recent years, the US has shifted its focus toward deepening ties with India, especially in the context of countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Despite this shift, Washington has consistently played a mediating role during key crises, such as the **Kargil conflict (1999)** and the **2001-2002 military standoff**, by urging restraint on both sides to prevent nuclear escalation.

#### **China**
**China** is a key ally of Pakistan, providing significant military and economic assistance, including support for Pakistan’s nuclear program. The **China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)** is a cornerstone of their strategic relationship. China’s influence complicates Indo-Pak relations, as India views China’s growing presence in Pakistan, particularly in disputed territories like **Gilgit-Baltistan**, as a strategic threat. India’s own border tensions with China further strain the trilateral relationship.

#### **United Nations**
The **United Nations** has been involved in mediating the Kashmir dispute since **1948**, following the first Indo-Pak war. The **UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP)** monitors ceasefire violations along the **Line of Control (LoC)**, though its role has diminished as India views the Kashmir issue as a bilateral matter.

#### **International Organizations**
Organizations like the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)** have also impacted Indo-Pak relations, with Pakistan facing pressure to crack down on terrorist financing. Multilateral platforms such as the **South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)** have been stalled due to Indo-Pak tensions, limiting regional cooperation.

### **Conclusion**
The role of external powers and international organizations is crucial in mitigating conflicts between India and Pakistan. While global actors encourage dialogue and prevent escalation, the long-standing disputes between the two countries are largely influenced by regional dynamics and domestic considerations.
