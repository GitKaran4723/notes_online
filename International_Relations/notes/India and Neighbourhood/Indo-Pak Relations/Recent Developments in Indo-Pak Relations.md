### **Recent Developments in Indo-Pak Relations**

Indo-Pak relations have seen significant fluctuations from **2020 to 2024**, shaped by political developments, border tensions, and sporadic diplomatic engagements. The core issues, such as the **Kashmir dispute**, **cross-border terrorism**, and **ceasefire violations**, remain unresolved, but some noteworthy developments during this period reflect both moments of de-escalation and continued strain.

### **1. Reaffirmation of Ceasefire (2021)**
One of the most significant developments during this period was the reaffirmation of the **2003 ceasefire agreement** along the **Line of Control (LoC)** in **February 2021**. In a joint statement, the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of both India and Pakistan agreed to strictly observe all ceasefire agreements along the LoC and other sectors, starting on February 24-25, 2021. This development brought temporary relief to the border regions, reducing skirmishes and providing respite to civilians living near the LoC.

While the ceasefire agreement led to a noticeable decline in ceasefire violations in 2021 and 2022, tensions remained high due to unresolved core issues like Kashmir and cross-border terrorism.

### **2. Kartarpur Corridor**
The **Kartarpur Corridor**, opened in **2019**, continued to function as a symbol of goodwill, allowing Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the **Gurdwara Darbar Sahib** in Pakistan without requiring a visa. Despite political tensions, the corridor remained open, reflecting both countries' commitment to preserving religious and cultural ties, particularly around Sikh pilgrimages. In 2022 and 2023, the corridor facilitated religious exchanges, fostering a rare avenue of peaceful engagement between the two countries.

### **3. Cross-Border Terrorism and India’s Response**
Cross-border terrorism continued to be a significant source of tension in Indo-Pak relations during this period. India consistently accused Pakistan of harboring terrorist groups that operate against India, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. Key events included:
- **Terrorist Attacks**: In 2022 and 2023, India witnessed sporadic terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, which were attributed to Pakistan-based militant groups like **Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)** and **Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)**.
- **India's Counterterrorism Efforts**: India responded by intensifying counterterrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir, and diplomatic efforts to isolate Pakistan on the global stage continued. India maintained pressure on Pakistan through platforms like the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)** to take action against terrorist financing.

### **4. FATF and Pakistan's Grey List Status**
Pakistan’s status on the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list** was a significant development in Indo-Pak relations. Pakistan remained under intense scrutiny from FATF for its failure to curb terrorist financing and money laundering. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Pakistan made efforts to meet FATF’s demands by prosecuting members of militant groups, including individuals linked to attacks on India, such as **Hafiz Saeed** and **Masood Azhar**.

In **October 2022**, Pakistan was **removed from the FATF grey list** after demonstrating progress in combating terrorist financing. India continued to express concerns, insisting that Pakistan had not taken enough verifiable action against the core leadership of terror groups involved in attacks on Indian soil.

### **5. Diplomatic Tensions Over Kashmir**
The revocation of **Article 370** in **August 2019**, which stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status, remained a point of contention between India and Pakistan. Pakistan continued to raise the issue of Kashmir on international platforms, including the **United Nations**, accusing India of human rights violations and seeking global intervention.

India, on the other hand, maintained that Kashmir is an internal matter and rejected any external mediation. Diplomatic tensions flared on several occasions during 2021-2024, with Pakistan’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister making strong statements against India’s policies in Kashmir. India, in turn, highlighted Pakistan’s lack of action on cross-border terrorism.

### **6. No Resumption of Formal Dialogue**
Throughout this period, there was **no formal resumption of bilateral talks** between India and Pakistan. While backchannel diplomacy was reported in early 2021, particularly around the reaffirmation of the ceasefire agreement, no official diplomatic talks were initiated. India maintained its stance that meaningful dialogue with Pakistan would only be possible if Pakistan took verifiable action against terrorist groups operating from its territory.

### **7. Impact of the Afghanistan Situation**
The developments in **Afghanistan** following the **Taliban’s return to power in 2021** had ripple effects on Indo-Pak relations. India expressed concerns over the resurgence of terror groups like the **Haqqani network** and the **Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)**, both of which have links to Pakistan. India’s investments in Afghanistan and its diplomatic engagement with the previous Afghan government also suffered setbacks, further complicating regional dynamics.

Pakistan, meanwhile, saw the situation in Afghanistan as an opportunity to increase its strategic depth in the region. This divergence in interests further added to the complexity of India-Pakistan relations, with both countries viewing the Afghan situation through different lenses.

### **8. Limited Economic Engagement**
Economic engagement between India and Pakistan remained minimal throughout this period. In response to India’s revocation of Article 370 in 2019, Pakistan had suspended all trade with India. Despite calls from certain sections of civil society and business communities in both countries for the resumption of trade, no significant progress was made in 2021-2024. The economic potential of bilateral trade, especially in agriculture and textiles, remained untapped due to political and security-related obstacles.

### **9. People-to-People Exchanges**
People-to-people exchanges, such as cultural programs, sports events, and academic interactions, were severely limited during this period due to political tensions and pandemic-related restrictions. However, some cross-border humanitarian efforts continued, such as the **Kartarpur Corridor** and the exchange of prisoners and fishermen.

### **10. Border Skirmishes**
Despite the 2021 ceasefire agreement, occasional skirmishes and ceasefire violations were reported along the LoC, particularly in **2022 and 2023**. While the intensity of these violations was lower than in previous years, they continued to disrupt peace in the region. Both countries accused each other of initiating cross-border firing, leading to military responses from both sides.

### **Conclusion**
From **2020 to 2024**, Indo-Pak relations remained tense, dominated by issues such as cross-border terrorism, the Kashmir dispute, and sporadic border skirmishes. Despite the reaffirmation of the ceasefire in 2021 and backchannel diplomacy, there was no formal resumption of dialogue. While the Kartarpur Corridor symbolized hope for people-to-people exchanges, broader political and security concerns overshadowed any significant progress in bilateral relations. The relationship between India and Pakistan remains fragile, with core issues unresolved, but the presence of nuclear deterrence and occasional diplomatic engagement has helped prevent major conflicts during this period.
