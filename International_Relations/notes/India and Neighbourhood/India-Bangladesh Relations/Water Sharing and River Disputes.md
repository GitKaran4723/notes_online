# Water Sharing and River Disputes

### **Water Sharing and River Disputes between India and Bangladesh**

Water sharing is a crucial aspect of India-Bangladesh relations due to the presence of several transboundary rivers, the most prominent being the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Teesta. As both nations depend on these rivers for irrigation, drinking water, and energy generation, disputes over water sharing have become a sensitive issue in their bilateral relationship. The management of these water resources is vital for sustaining agriculture, livelihoods, and ecosystems in both countries.

#### **1. Teesta River Dispute**
   - **Overview**: The Teesta River originates in the Indian state of Sikkim and flows through West Bengal before entering Bangladesh. It is one of the most contentious issues in the India-Bangladesh relationship, particularly because both countries rely on the river for agriculture and drinking water.
   - **Historical Context**: The issue of Teesta water sharing dates back to the early 1980s when discussions between India and Bangladesh began. An ad-hoc arrangement was made in 1983 for the allocation of water during the dry season (October to April), but no formal agreement has been reached since then.
   - **Current Status**: Bangladesh demands a fairer share of Teesta's water, as the river is crucial for irrigating crops in its northern regions. India, particularly West Bengal, argues that it needs water for its own agricultural needs, especially in the Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts.
   - **Stalled Negotiations**: While a draft agreement was formulated in 2011 that proposed sharing the water equally, the deal has not been signed due to resistance from the state government of West Bengal. This has led to tensions between the central government of India and West Bengal on one hand, and India and Bangladesh on the other.

#### **2. Ganges Water Treaty**
   - **Historical Importance**: The Ganges is one of the major rivers shared by India and Bangladesh. The river originates in the Indian Himalayas and flows through India before entering Bangladesh, where it joins the Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers. The dispute over the sharing of the Ganges water dates back to the 1950s.
   - **Farakka Barrage**: In the early 1970s, India constructed the Farakka Barrage to divert water from the Ganges to the Hooghly River to maintain the port of Kolkata. Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) opposed this, arguing that the diversion of water negatively impacted its agriculture and ecosystems downstream.
   - **1996 Ganges Water Treaty**: After prolonged negotiations, India and Bangladesh signed the Ganges Water Treaty in 1996. The treaty governs the sharing of water from the Ganges during the dry season (January to May) for a period of 30 years. It stipulates that India and Bangladesh will receive a specified quantity of water based on the availability in the river, ensuring that both countries have access to sufficient water for their needs.
   - **Impact and Challenges**: The treaty has helped manage water-sharing issues, but challenges remain, especially during periods of low water flow, which affect both countries. Climate change and upstream activities continue to impact the flow of the Ganges, leading to occasional disagreements.

#### **3. Brahmaputra River Management**
   - **Geographical Context**: The Brahmaputra River originates in Tibet (China) and flows through India (Assam) before entering Bangladesh. It is one of the largest rivers in the world and plays a critical role in the agriculture, fishing, and transportation sectors of both India and Bangladesh.
   - **Challenges**: While India and Bangladesh share the river, they have different priorities in managing it. India uses the Brahmaputra for hydroelectric power generation, while Bangladesh relies on its flow for agriculture, navigation, and flood control.
   - **China’s Role**: A complicating factor in Brahmaputra river management is China, as the river originates there. China’s plans to build dams on the river have caused concern in both India and Bangladesh. Any major disruption in the river’s flow could have serious implications downstream.
   - **Collaboration**: Despite these challenges, India and Bangladesh have not yet faced significant disputes over the Brahmaputra. However, there is a growing need for cooperative river management and better flood forecasting systems to address the potential impacts of climate change on water availability.

#### **4. Joint River Commission (JRC)**
   - **Establishment**: India and Bangladesh established the Joint River Commission (JRC) in 1972 to manage water-sharing issues and promote cooperation on the 54 rivers that flow between the two countries.
   - **Objective**: The JRC’s primary objective is to ensure the equitable sharing of transboundary rivers, especially during the lean seasons, and to address concerns related to water quality, pollution, and river navigation.
   - **Challenges and Limitations**: While the JRC has been instrumental in fostering dialogue, it has been criticized for its slow decision-making process and inability to resolve key issues, such as the Teesta dispute. The commission faces challenges in addressing the increasing demand for water resources due to population growth, industrialization, and climate change.

#### **5. Climate Change and Riverine Ecosystems**
   - **Impact of Climate Change**: Climate change is expected to exacerbate water scarcity in both India and Bangladesh. Changing rainfall patterns, glacial melting in the Himalayas, and rising sea levels could significantly affect river flows and intensify the existing water-sharing disputes.
   - **Flooding and Drought**: Bangladesh, being a low-lying country, is particularly vulnerable to flooding, while certain regions in both countries experience droughts due to erratic water flow. Both countries are working on strategies to manage the impacts of climate change on their water resources.
   - **Cooperative Efforts**: India and Bangladesh have been discussing cooperative strategies to manage water resources in the face of climate change, focusing on improving flood forecasting, sharing hydrological data, and developing joint river basin management plans.

### **Key Points to Remember**:
   - The **Teesta River dispute** remains unresolved, with Bangladesh seeking a fair share of water and India balancing its own needs, particularly in West Bengal.
   - The **Ganges Water Treaty** of 1996 is a landmark agreement that governs the sharing of Ganges waters, though challenges persist, especially during dry seasons.
   - The **Brahmaputra River** presents potential future challenges due to different priorities between India and Bangladesh and concerns about China’s upstream activities.
   - The **Joint River Commission (JRC)** serves as a platform for dialogue, but its effectiveness has been limited in resolving key disputes.
   - **Climate change** is exacerbating the challenges of water management, with both countries needing to cooperate on flood forecasting, river management, and sustainable water use.
