### Strategic Autonomy and Non-Alignment: India-France Relations

Strategic autonomy and non-alignment are fundamental principles that shape India-France relations, allowing both countries to pursue independent foreign policies while collaborating on shared interests.

1. **Strategic Autonomy**: Both India and France value their independence in decision-making on global issues, without aligning themselves completely with any major power bloc. This mutual respect for strategic autonomy has strengthened their partnership, enabling them to collaborate on areas like defence, security, and trade, while maintaining individual foreign policy stances.

2. **Non-Alignment**: India’s long-standing policy of non-alignment aligns with France’s approach to maintaining autonomy from dominant global coalitions like NATO. France has publicly opposed NATO+ partnerships, which would involve India, and India has similarly rejected being part of such coalitions, focusing instead on independent defence and security strategies.

3. **Avoidance of Alliances**: Both countries have refrained from involving each other in their respective military alliances. India and France focus on bilateral cooperation rather than aligning within rigid alliance structures, preserving flexibility in their international dealings.

4. **Cooperation in Global Forums**: Despite maintaining non-alignment, both countries actively collaborate in multilateral forums like the United Nations, G20, and climate initiatives, ensuring their strategic autonomy is balanced with international cooperation.

This alignment in strategic autonomy helps India and France to pursue independent yet collaborative approaches to global issues.
