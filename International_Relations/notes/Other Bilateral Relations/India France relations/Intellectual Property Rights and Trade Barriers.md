### Intellectual Property Rights and Trade Barriers: India-France Relations

Intellectual property rights (IPR) and trade barriers pose challenges in the otherwise strong economic and trade relationship between India and France. Addressing these issues is crucial for fostering greater cooperation in trade, technology transfer, and investment.

1. **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)**: France has raised concerns about the enforcement of IPR in India, particularly in sectors like pharmaceuticals, technology, and consumer goods. These concerns affect French companiesâ€™ confidence in operating within India, as they seek better protection for patents, trademarks, and copyrights.

2. **Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures**: Indian exports to France, particularly agricultural products, face challenges due to strict SPS measures imposed by the European Union. These measures act as non-tariff barriers, making it difficult for Indian products to enter the French market.

3. **Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Stagnation**: The absence of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between India and France limits the potential for maximizing trade. Additionally, slow progress on the *India-EU Broad-Based Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA)* has further delayed the expansion of economic cooperation.

4. **Trade Imbalance**: While trade between India and France is growing, a significant portion of this trade is dominated by defence products. This imbalance highlights the need for diversifying the trade relationship beyond defence to other sectors such as services, agriculture, and technology.

Addressing these issues will help unlock the full potential of India-France economic relations.
