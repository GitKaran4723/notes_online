### Indo-Pacific Partnership: India-France Relations

The Indo-Pacific partnership between India and France has emerged as a vital aspect of their strategic relations, focusing on ensuring peace, stability, and cooperation in this strategically significant region.

1. **Shared Vision**: Both countries share a common vision of a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific, underpinned by respect for international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

2. **Maritime Security**: India and France have intensified cooperation in maritime security, particularly in the Indian Ocean, which is crucial for global trade routes. Joint naval exercises, such as *Exercise Varuna*, reflect their commitment to maintaining maritime security and freedom of navigation.

3. **Regional Cooperation**: France, with its overseas territories and military presence in the Indian Ocean, is deeply invested in the region. Both countries work together with other regional partners, including Australia and the UAE, in trilateral frameworks to enhance security cooperation.

4. **Indo-Pacific Triangular Cooperation Fund**: India and France are exploring multilateral initiatives to support sustainable development, innovation, and green technology in the Indo-Pacific.

This partnership reinforces India and France's strategic autonomy and their shared interest in promoting stability and security in the Indo-Pacific region.
