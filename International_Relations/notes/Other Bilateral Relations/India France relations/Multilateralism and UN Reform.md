### Multilateralism and UN Reform: India-France Relations

India and France are strong advocates of multilateralism, working together to reform global institutions like the United Nations (UN) to better reflect the current global order.

1. **UN Security Council Reform**: France has consistently supported India’s bid for permanent membership in the *United Nations Security Council (UNSC)*, recognizing India’s role as a major global power. Both nations stress the need for a reformed, more representative, and effective UNSC.

2. **Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)**: Both countries emphasize the need for reform in *Multilateral Development Banks* like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They aim to enhance the effectiveness and inclusivity of these institutions to address global economic challenges.

3. **Global Governance**: India and France advocate for a rules-based international order, actively participating in multilateral forums such as the G20, where they push for cooperative solutions to global issues like climate change, economic inequality, and pandemic preparedness.

4. **Paris Club Cooperation**: India and France have enhanced their collaboration within the *Paris Club*, a group of creditor nations that handle debt restructuring, to manage international debt issues and promote global financial stability.

This multilateral cooperation underscores both nations' commitment to a more balanced and inclusive global governance system.
