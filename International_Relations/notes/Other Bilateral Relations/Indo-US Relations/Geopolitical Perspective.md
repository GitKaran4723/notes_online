**Geopolitical Perspective on Indo-US Relations**

The geopolitical perspective of Indo-US relations encompasses their strategic alignment in the global order, regional security dynamics, and their mutual efforts to balance the rise of other global powers, especially China. Both nations have increasingly cooperated on key geopolitical issues, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, while also facing some divergent approaches regarding their respective foreign policies.

### **Non-Alignment and Strategic Autonomy:**
Historically, India followed a policy of non-alignment during the Cold War, maintaining strategic autonomy and refraining from joining either the Western or Soviet blocs. The US, on the other hand, sought to create alliances with nations around the world to counter Soviet influence, often supporting India’s regional rival, Pakistan. Despite these differences, post-Cold War developments, especially the disintegration of the Soviet Union, shifted India’s approach toward a more pragmatic alignment with the US.

Today, India still adheres to a policy of strategic autonomy, preferring not to be tied down by formal alliances. However, India’s growing relationship with the US reflects a convergence on several key geopolitical issues, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, while maintaining its independent foreign policy stance.

### **The Indo-Pacific Region and China’s Assertiveness:**
The Indo-Pacific region has become a central area of cooperation between India and the US. Both nations share a common interest in ensuring a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific, where the rule of law, freedom of navigation, and respect for sovereignty are upheld. This is especially relevant in the context of China’s increasing assertiveness, particularly in the South China Sea.

- **QUAD (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue):** India and the US, along with Japan and Australia, are members of the QUAD, a strategic forum aimed at enhancing cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The QUAD is seen as a counterbalance to China’s growing influence in the region, although India remains cautious about being seen as fully aligned against China due to its own economic and security interests with Beijing.

- **Freedom of Navigation:** Both India and the US are strong proponents of freedom of navigation, especially in the contested waters of the South China Sea, where China has made expansive territorial claims. The US has conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in these waters, while India has called for adherence to international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

### **Balancing China’s Rise:**
India and the US share concerns about China’s rapid rise and its geopolitical ambitions, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its military modernization. While the US has taken a more confrontational stance toward China, especially under the Trump administration, India prefers a more balanced approach due to its geographical proximity and significant trade ties with China.

Despite border tensions with China, India avoids openly joining an anti-China alliance. However, the 2020 border clashes in Ladakh, along with China’s growing influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean, have pushed India closer to the US in terms of regional security cooperation.

### **Pakistan and Terrorism:**
Pakistan has long been a source of tension in Indo-US relations. Historically, the US has supported Pakistan, especially during the Cold War and after 9/11, due to its strategic location and role in counterterrorism efforts. This created friction with India, which views Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism, particularly due to its support for insurgent groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir.

- **US Shift on Pakistan:** In recent years, the US has reduced its reliance on Pakistan, particularly as it winds down its involvement in Afghanistan. However, India remains wary of Pakistan’s continued influence in the region and its support for terrorist activities. The US has backed India’s efforts to designate Pakistan-based terror groups and individuals, like Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, under international sanctions.

### **Afghan Peace Process:**
The US-led Afghan Peace Process, which culminated in a peace agreement with the Taliban, has been a point of divergence between India and the US. India has traditionally opposed any negotiations with the Taliban, viewing it as a proxy of Pakistan and a destabilizing force in the region. India has instead advocated for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process that excludes external interference.

- **US Withdrawal from Afghanistan:** The US decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by 2021 has raised concerns in India about the resurgence of the Taliban and the increased influence of Pakistan. India is a major development partner in Afghanistan, having invested in infrastructure, education, and healthcare. The US’s reliance on Pakistan in the peace process, coupled with India’s exclusion from key negotiations, has caused anxiety in New Delhi about its strategic interests in the region.

### **Multilateral and Global Cooperation:**
India and the US cooperate in several multilateral forums and global initiatives, with both nations pushing for reforms in global governance structures to reflect the changing global order.

- **United Nations Security Council (UNSC):** The US has consistently supported India’s bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). India, as an emerging power, seeks to reform the UNSC to include more representation from developing nations, while the US views India’s inclusion as essential for strengthening global governance.
  
- **Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG):** The US has backed India’s bid for membership in the NSG, a group that controls nuclear exports and non-proliferation. Despite US support, China has blocked India’s entry into the NSG, citing India’s non-signatory status to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

- **G-7 and Global Economic Institutions:** The US has also proposed India’s inclusion in the expanded G-7, which would provide India with a greater role in shaping global economic and trade policies. This move reflects India’s growing importance in global economic and strategic affairs.

### **Challenges in the Geopolitical Sphere:**
Despite growing strategic convergence, there are areas of divergence in Indo-US relations, particularly in how they approach certain global issues:
- **China Policy:** While both nations recognize the challenge posed by China, India’s approach is more cautious, balancing economic engagement with security concerns, while the US has adopted a more confrontational stance.
- **Afghanistan and Pakistan:** The US’s reliance on Pakistan for its Afghan strategy, despite India’s objections, remains a significant point of contention.

### **Conclusion:**
From a geopolitical perspective, Indo-US relations are shaped by shared interests in maintaining global order, countering the rise of China, and ensuring stability in the Indo-Pacific. While there are challenges, particularly in managing relations with Pakistan and diverging approaches to the Afghan Peace Process, the overall trend is toward greater strategic alignment. As India continues to rise as a regional and global power, the US will play a key role in supporting its geopolitical ambitions, ensuring that the Indo-US partnership remains a cornerstone of 21st-century international relations.
