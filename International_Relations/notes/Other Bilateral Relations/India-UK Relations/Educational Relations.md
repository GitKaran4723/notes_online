---

#### 1. **Historical Ties in Education**
The history of educational relations between India and the UK dates back to the colonial era when British educational institutions significantly influenced India’s academic and administrative structures. British universities have historically been attractive destinations for Indian students seeking higher education, and many of India’s leading institutions, such as the **Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)** and **Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs)**, were inspired by British models.

Over the decades, this historical connection has evolved into a more modern partnership that emphasizes collaboration in higher education, skill development, and research. Educational exchanges between India and the UK are now a vital part of their bilateral relationship, with thousands of Indian students pursuing higher education in the UK every year.

#### 2. **UK-India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI)**
One of the most significant initiatives driving educational collaboration between India and the UK is the **UK-India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI)**, launched in 2005. This initiative has been a cornerstone of the educational relationship between the two countries, focusing on three key areas: **higher education**, **research**, and **skill development**.

Key objectives of UKIERI include:

- **Higher Education and Research**: UKIERI has facilitated numerous academic partnerships between Indian and British universities, encouraging joint research programs and student exchanges. The initiative promotes collaborative research in areas like climate change, health sciences, engineering, and social sciences.
  
- **Professional and Technical Skills**: UKIERI also emphasizes skill development and vocational training. Through this initiative, both countries work together to bridge the skills gap in critical industries such as information technology, engineering, and healthcare.

- **Schools and Youth Engagement**: The program has also been instrumental in fostering school-level partnerships and youth exchanges, allowing students from both countries to experience different educational systems and cultures. This initiative helps build mutual understanding and long-term relationships between the two nations.

Since its inception, UKIERI has been renewed multiple times due to its success in promoting educational ties between India and the UK. The initiative has resulted in over **200 new partnerships** between academic institutions in both countries, creating opportunities for joint research, student mobility, and academic development.

#### 3. **Student Mobility and Scholarships**
One of the most prominent aspects of the educational relationship between India and the UK is the movement of students between the two countries. The UK has long been a favored destination for Indian students seeking world-class education, particularly in fields such as engineering, medicine, law, and business management.

In 2020, over **55,000 Indian students** were studying in the UK, making India the second-largest source of international students in the country. The UK’s prestigious universities, such as **Oxford**, **Cambridge**, **Imperial College London**, and the **London School of Economics**, continue to attract Indian students seeking high-quality education.

- **Scholarship Programs**: To support Indian students, both the Indian and British governments have introduced various scholarship programs. Some of the prominent scholarship schemes include:
  - **Chevening Scholarships**: This prestigious UK government scholarship offers Indian students the opportunity to pursue one-year master’s degrees in the UK in fields such as law, economics, and public policy.

  - **GREAT Scholarships**: This program, funded by the UK government’s **GREAT Britain Campaign** and British universities, offers scholarships to Indian students for a wide range of academic disciplines.

- **UK’s Post-Study Work Visa**: A key development in recent years has been the introduction of the **Graduate Route**, also known as the **post-study work visa**. This allows international students, including those from India, to stay and work in the UK for up to two years (three years for Ph.D. graduates) after completing their degree. This visa has made the UK even more attractive for Indian students, as it provides them with opportunities to gain work experience and apply their skills in a global market.
