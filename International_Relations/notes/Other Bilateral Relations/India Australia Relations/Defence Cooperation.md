**Defence Cooperation in India-Australia Relations**

Defence cooperation between India and Australia has emerged as a key element of their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The two countries have steadily expanded their military and security collaboration, reflecting their mutual concerns over regional security, particularly in the Indo-Pacific.

A major milestone in defence cooperation was the signing of the **Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA)** in 2020, which allows both nations to access each other’s military bases for refueling, repairs, and resupply. This agreement enhances the operational flexibility of both countries’ armed forces, especially during joint exercises and humanitarian missions.

In **September 2021**, the **2+2 Ministerial Dialogue** was initiated, bringing together the defence and foreign ministers of both countries. This forum strengthens strategic coordination and fosters deeper dialogue on defence policy and security challenges.

Joint military exercises have further solidified defence ties. India and Australia have participated in several high-profile exercises such as **AUSINDEX** and **Malabar** (involving Japan and the US as well). Additionally, India has been invited to participate in Australia's **Talisman Sabre** exercises in 2023, reflecting the growing interoperability between their armed forces.

This deepening defence partnership is also a response to shared concerns over regional security, particularly the growing influence of China in the Indo-Pacific. Both countries are committed to upholding a **rules-based international order** and enhancing maritime security in the region.
