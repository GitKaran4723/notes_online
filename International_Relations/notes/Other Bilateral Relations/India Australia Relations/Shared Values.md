**Shared Values in India-Australia Relations**

India and Australia share a strong foundation of common values, which has played a crucial role in fostering deeper bilateral ties. Both countries are vibrant, secular, multicultural democracies with Westminster-style parliamentary systems, which creates a natural synergy between them. These shared democratic principles promote cooperation on global governance, human rights, and the rule of law, enhancing their mutual trust.

The commitment to a **rules-based international order** is another significant shared value, particularly in the context of the Indo-Pacific region. Both nations advocate for free, open, and inclusive regional frameworks and oppose any unilateral or coercive measures that undermine regional peace and stability.

Additionally, the two countries share a free press and independent judicial systems, which further strengthens their democratic frameworks. The **English language** serves as a common medium, facilitating smoother communication and collaboration in various sectors such as diplomacy, education, and business.

These shared values extend into their **multicultural societies**, where large and diverse populations coexist, reflecting similar societal challenges and opportunities. The Indian diaspora in Australia, one of the largest overseas-born groups, plays a pivotal role in strengthening people-to-people connections and enhancing mutual cultural understanding, making shared values a strong pillar of their bilateral relationship.
