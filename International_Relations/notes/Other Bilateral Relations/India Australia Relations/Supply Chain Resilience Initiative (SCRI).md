# Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI)

**Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) in India-Australia Relations**

The **Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI)** is a trilateral partnership between India, Australia, and Japan aimed at enhancing the resilience of supply chains in the **Indo-Pacific** region. This initiative was launched in 2021 in response to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and growing concerns over dependency on single-country supply chains, particularly China.

The SCRI focuses on diversifying and strengthening supply chains to mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on any one country. It aims to create a more secure and robust supply chain network that ensures the uninterrupted flow of essential goods, including critical technologies, minerals, and components.

For India and Australia, the SCRI is a strategic move to reduce their dependency on Chinese manufacturing and logistics. It promotes collaboration in key sectors such as **critical minerals**, where Australia has vast reserves, and India seeks secure access to these resources for its energy and technology needs. The initiative also encourages investments in infrastructure, research, and innovation to support regional supply chain development.

The SCRI strengthens India's and Australiaâ€™s economic and strategic ties by addressing vulnerabilities in global trade and ensuring the availability of essential goods in times of crisis. It aligns with their broader objective of maintaining a **rules-based international order** and ensuring economic security in the Indo-Pacific.
