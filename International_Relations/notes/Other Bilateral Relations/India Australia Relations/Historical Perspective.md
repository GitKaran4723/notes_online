**Historical Perspective of India-Australia Relations**

India and Australia established formal diplomatic relations in 1941 during the pre-Independence period, with the opening of the Consulate General of India in Sydney. Initially, the relationship was limited to trade and diplomatic ties. However, bilateral relations faced a major setback in 1998 when Australia condemned India’s nuclear tests, resulting in a low point in their diplomatic engagement.

The turning point came in 2014 when Australia signed a historic uranium supply deal with India, recognizing India’s “impeccable” non-proliferation record, despite its non-signatory status to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This agreement was crucial for India's civil nuclear energy needs, given Australia’s large reserves of uranium.

Over the years, shared values such as a commitment to democracy, rule of law, and a Westminster-style parliamentary system, coupled with a free press and independent judiciary, have become the foundation for a stronger relationship. Both nations also share multicultural societies, with a significant Indian diaspora contributing to Australia's social fabric.

In 2020, both countries elevated their ties to a **Comprehensive Strategic Partnership**, reflecting the growing convergence of strategic, economic, and political interests, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. This historical journey marks a transition from limited engagement to a robust, multi-dimensional partnership between the two nations.
