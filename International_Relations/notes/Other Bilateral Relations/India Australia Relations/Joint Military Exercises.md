**Joint Military Exercises in India-Australia Relations**

Joint military exercises between India and Australia have become a cornerstone of their defence cooperation, reflecting the increasing strategic alignment between the two countries, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. These exercises aim to enhance interoperability, strengthen maritime security, and improve the tactical coordination of both armed forces.

The **Malabar Exercise**, initially a trilateral naval exercise involving India, the US, and Japan, saw the inclusion of Australia in 2020, signifying the deepening defence ties within the **Quad framework**. Malabar focuses on naval drills and emphasizes maritime security, anti-submarine warfare, and coordination in the face of regional threats, particularly from China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.

Additionally, the **AUSINDEX** (Australia-India Naval Exercises), held biennially, has been a key bilateral naval exercise since 2015, focusing on enhancing maritime cooperation and building trust between their navies. The exercise has expanded in scope over time, covering complex naval maneuvers, anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine operations.

In **2023**, India was also invited to participate in Australiaâ€™s **Talisman Sabre** exercises, further demonstrating the strengthening defence partnership. These exercises, involving several international partners, focus on enhancing operational readiness and response capabilities for regional security challenges.

These joint military engagements underline the strategic importance of the Indo-Pacific region to both countries and their shared commitment to maintaining a **rules-based order** and countering emerging threats.
