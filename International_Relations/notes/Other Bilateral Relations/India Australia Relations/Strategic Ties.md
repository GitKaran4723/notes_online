**Strategic Ties in India-Australia Relations**

The strategic relationship between India and Australia has significantly deepened over the past decade, with both nations recognizing the importance of cooperation in ensuring regional stability, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. In **2020**, the two countries elevated their bilateral relationship to a **Comprehensive Strategic Partnership** during a virtual summit, reflecting their growing alignment on strategic interests.

Key areas of strategic engagement include **defense cooperation**, maritime security, and intelligence sharing. Both countries have a shared interest in maintaining a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific, particularly against the backdrop of China's growing assertiveness in the region. The **Quad alliance** (India, Australia, the US, and Japan) is a vital platform for cooperation, underscoring their commitment to a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific.

The signing of the **Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA)** in 2020 marked a milestone in defense collaboration, allowing access to each other's military bases for refueling and logistics. Additionally, the **2+2 Ministerial Dialogue**, which began in **September 2021**, provides a regular mechanism for high-level defense and foreign policy discussions.

This strategic convergence, especially in maritime security, defense exercises, and counterterrorism, underpins the growing importance of India-Australia ties in maintaining regional peace and stability, making their partnership crucial in shaping the Indo-Pacificâ€™s future.
