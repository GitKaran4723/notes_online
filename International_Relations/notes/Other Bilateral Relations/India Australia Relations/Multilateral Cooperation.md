**Multilateral Cooperation in India-Australia Relations**

India and Australia share a strong commitment to multilateralism and have cooperated extensively within various international and regional forums. Their alignment in multilateral platforms reflects their shared values of democracy, rule of law, and the importance of a **rules-based international order**, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.

One of the most significant multilateral engagements between the two countries is their participation in the **Quad** grouping, which includes India, Australia, the United States, and Japan. The Quad focuses on maintaining a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific, ensuring maritime security, and countering coercive activities in the region. It serves as a platform for strategic dialogue, enhancing regional cooperation on critical issues like climate change, cybersecurity, and infrastructure development.

Both nations are also members of other regional organizations, such as the **Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)**, the **ASEAN Regional Forum**, and the **East Asia Summit**, which promote economic integration, maritime security, and regional stability.

In the global context, India and Australia collaborate within the framework of the **World Trade Organization (WTO)**, where they are part of the **Five Interested Parties (FIP)**, working on reforming global trade rules and ensuring fair trade practices.

Australia is a key player in the **Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)**, and although India is not a member, Australia supports Indiaâ€™s inclusion in this crucial economic forum.

This multilateral cooperation strengthens the diplomatic ties between India and Australia, allowing them to work collaboratively to address global challenges and uphold international norms.
