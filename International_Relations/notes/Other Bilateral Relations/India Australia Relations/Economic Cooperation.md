**Economic Cooperation in India-Australia Relations**

Economic cooperation has become a key pillar of India-Australia relations, marked by increasing bilateral trade, investment, and collaboration in key sectors. The signing of the **Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA)** in **2022** was a significant milestone, as it is India's first free trade agreement with a developed country in over a decade. This agreement has resulted in the immediate reduction of duties to **zero** on **96% of Indian exports** to Australia and **85% of Australian exports** to India, enhancing trade flow between the two nations.

Australia is India’s **17th largest trading partner**, and India is Australia’s **9th largest trading partner**. Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at **US$ 27.5 billion** in 2021, with the potential to reach **US$ 50 billion** in the next five years. Key sectors of trade include mining, energy, agriculture, education, and information technology.

The two countries are also part of the **Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI)**, along with Japan, aimed at strengthening supply chain resilience in the Indo-Pacific region. This initiative is particularly important in diversifying supply chains away from China and ensuring stable access to critical goods.

India and Australia are also exploring deeper cooperation in critical minerals, clean energy, and technology, with a special focus on renewable energy and the development of clean hydrogen.

The robust economic partnership reflects a broader alignment of economic interests, driven by both nations' desire to secure their supply chains, diversify trade, and build resilient economies in the Indo-Pacific region.
