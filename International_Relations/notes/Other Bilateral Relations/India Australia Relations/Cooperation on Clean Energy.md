# Cooperation on Clean Energy

**Cooperation on Clean Energy in India-Australia Relations**

Clean energy cooperation is a critical area in the growing partnership between India and Australia, driven by both nations' commitment to reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to sustainable energy sources. In **February 2022**, the two countries signed a **Letter of Intent on New and Renewable Energy**, marking their collaboration to reduce the cost of renewable energy technologies, including **ultra-low-cost solar** and **clean hydrogen**.

Australia, with its vast natural resources, is a key supplier of critical minerals required for renewable energy technologies. This partnership focuses on enhancing India’s access to Australia’s resources such as **lithium** and **cobalt**, which are essential for electric vehicles and battery storage technologies.

India and Australia have also committed to investing in renewable energy projects under the **India-Australia Critical Minerals Investment Partnership**. Both countries have pledged USD 5.8 million to support projects over the next three years, emphasizing clean energy development.

India is a founding member of the **International Solar Alliance (ISA)**, and Australia has contributed AUD 10 million to support renewable energy initiatives for **Pacific Island countries** under this alliance, further strengthening their clean energy ties.

This collaboration not only addresses climate change challenges but also fosters economic cooperation by creating new opportunities for trade and investment in the clean energy sector, cementing India and Australia’s commitment to a sustainable future.
