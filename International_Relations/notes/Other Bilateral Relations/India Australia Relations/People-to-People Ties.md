**People-to-People Ties in India-Australia Relations**

People-to-people ties form a significant pillar of India-Australia relations, fostering deeper connections beyond diplomatic and economic cooperation. India is one of the largest sources of skilled immigrants to Australia, contributing to its economy and society. According to the 2021 Australian Census, around **9.76 lakh people of Indian origin** reside in Australia, making them the second-largest group of overseas-born residents in the country.

The Indian diaspora actively contributes to various sectors, including healthcare, education, IT, and business, enhancing the multicultural fabric of Australian society. This growing Indian community has facilitated stronger cultural exchanges, and their contribution has been pivotal in shaping public perception and policies.

Moreover, education has become a key area of cooperation. **Over 1 lakh Indian students** are enrolled in Australian universities, making Indian students the second-largest group of foreign students in Australia. This educational exchange not only builds personal ties but also enhances professional networks that can benefit both nations in the long term.

These strong people-to-people ties help foster a better understanding of cultural diversity and contribute to the growing warmth in diplomatic and economic relations, making this aspect a vital cornerstone in India-Australia relations.
