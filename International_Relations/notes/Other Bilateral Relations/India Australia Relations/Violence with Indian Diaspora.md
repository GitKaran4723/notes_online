# Violence with Indian Diaspora

**Violence with Indian Diaspora in India-Australia Relations**

Incidents of violence targeting the **Indian diaspora** in Australia have been a significant concern in bilateral relations. The Indian community, which forms the second-largest overseas-born group in Australia, has occasionally been subject to **racially motivated attacks**. These incidents, particularly involving Indian students, garnered widespread media attention and diplomatic engagement between the two countries.

In the past, there have been cases of physical assaults, robberies, and vandalism, which raised concerns about the safety of Indian nationals in Australia. Although Australian authorities have condemned such acts and taken steps to improve security, these incidents have caused strain, particularly given the large Indian student population in Australian universities.

Recently, the issue has expanded with the rise of **Khalistan supporters** in Australia, who have been involved in **vandalism** of Indian temples and clashes with members of the Indian diaspora. These acts, carried out by pro-Khalistan separatist elements, have caused diplomatic tensions, as they are seen as an attempt to stir communal unrest within the Indian community in Australia.

Both the Indian and Australian governments have condemned these acts and have committed to ensuring the safety and security of the Indian diaspora. Australia has increased efforts to address hate crimes and improve community policing, while also working to counter the influence of extremist groups.

Resolving these issues is crucial for maintaining the strong people-to-people ties and ensuring the continued warmth in India-Australia relations.
