## Why Study International Relations?

- The world is divided into nations, and people live within these nations. Every person is attached to one or another state, and these states interact with each other.
- International Relations (IR) teaches us about the interactions between states and how these interactions affect common people.
- These interactions create historical, political, and socio-economic consequences for domestic populations.
- A primary question among us is how states evolved and how they reached the present condition of the world.

## How Did States Evolve?

- The state is a creation of man, not of nature.
- In the early stages, humans led a nomadic life. Later, they learned agriculture and domesticated animals, which led them to decide to live a settled life.
- As humans settled in one place, populations slowly grew and formed **microcosmic societies** (smaller systems representative of a larger one). These societies developed in various areas, with many being established near water sources.
- As the societies grew, there was a need to establish some rules to the memebers of the societies.
- When the rules made there was a requirement of authority to implement the set rules, requirement of protection from other societies, protection was the most common reason why a strong ruler emerged.
