# Agreements under WTO

### **World Trade Organization (WTO) - Agreements**

WTO agreements are the legal foundation of the global trading system. They provide the rules and guidelines by which international trade operates. These agreements cover goods, services, and intellectual property, along with various other trade-related issues. Below are the most important agreements under the WTO framework:

### 1. **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**
   - **GATT 1947**: The predecessor to the WTO and focused on regulating trade in goods.
   - **GATT 1994**: An updated version included in the WTO’s agreements, it forms the basis for trade in goods under the WTO.
   - **Purpose**: Reduce tariffs and other trade barriers to encourage the free flow of goods across borders.
   - **Key principles**: Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) and National Treatment, ensuring non-discrimination in international trade.

### 2. **General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)**
   - GATS regulates the **trade in services**, such as banking, telecommunications, and tourism.
   - The agreement requires countries to **liberalize service sectors** and make commitments on market access.
   - Like GATT, GATS incorporates the **MFN and National Treatment principles**, ensuring that foreign service providers receive the same treatment as domestic providers once they enter a market.
   - Countries have the flexibility to **choose which service sectors** they want to open up for foreign competition.

### 3. **Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)**
   - TRIPS is one of the most comprehensive agreements on **intellectual property (IP)**, covering patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other forms of intellectual property rights.
   - It sets minimum standards for the **protection and enforcement** of IP rights, ensuring that all member countries uphold these standards.
   - TRIPS has been particularly important in sectors like **pharmaceuticals**, where patent protection is critical.
   - The agreement also recognizes **public health concerns**, allowing exceptions (such as compulsory licensing) in case of national emergencies.

### 4. **Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)**
   - The AoA addresses issues related to **trade in agricultural products**.
   - It focuses on three main areas:
     1. **Market Access**: Reducing tariffs and other trade barriers on agricultural goods.
     2. **Domestic Support**: Discouraging trade-distorting subsidies that artificially lower the price of agricultural products.
     3. **Export Competition**: Phasing out export subsidies that give unfair advantages to farmers in certain countries.
   - The AoA is particularly important for **developing countries**, as agriculture is a key sector for their economies.

### 5. **Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS)**
   - TRIMS focuses on how a country’s **investment regulations** affect international trade.
   - It prohibits **investment measures** that restrict or distort trade, such as policies that require foreign firms to use local products or impose export quotas on foreign investors.
   - The agreement aims to ensure **fair treatment of foreign investments** in domestic markets, helping to create a more open and competitive investment environment.

### 6. **Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement)**
   - The SPS Agreement deals with food safety, animal health, and plant health regulations.
   - It allows countries to adopt measures to protect human, animal, and plant life, but these measures must be based on **scientific evidence** and should not be used as **disguised protectionism**.
   - For example, a country may impose **sanitary restrictions** on imported meat to prevent the spread of diseases, but it must be based on internationally accepted standards.

### 7. **Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement)**
   - The TBT Agreement focuses on the **technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessments** related to trade.
   - It ensures that technical regulations are not used as unnecessary trade barriers, meaning that product standards must not discriminate against foreign products.
   - The agreement promotes the use of **international standards** to make trade easier and more predictable.

### 8. **Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU)**
   - The DSU is the **legal basis for settling disputes** between WTO members.
   - It provides a formal process involving consultations, panels, and an Appellate Body to resolve trade conflicts.
   - The DSU ensures that disputes are resolved **according to agreed rules**, reducing the risk of unilateral actions by countries.

### 9. **Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement)**
   - The SCM Agreement regulates the use of **subsidies** and the actions countries can take to counteract the negative effects of subsidized imports.
   - It defines when subsidies are permitted and when they are **prohibited**.
   - **Countervailing measures**, like additional duties, can be imposed if subsidized imports cause injury to domestic industries.

### 10. **Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)**
   - The TFA aims to **speed up the movement, release, and clearance of goods** across borders by simplifying customs procedures.
   - It focuses on **cutting red tape** and improving cooperation between customs authorities to make trade more efficient.
   - The TFA is particularly beneficial to **developing countries**, helping them reduce trade costs and improve their integration into the global economy.

### **Key Terms to Remember:**
   - **GATT**: Agreement covering trade in goods.
   - **GATS**: Agreement covering trade in services.
   - **TRIPS**: Agreement on intellectual property rights.
   - **AoA**: Regulates agricultural trade.
   - **TRIMS**: Regulates investment measures affecting trade.
   - **SPS**: Food safety and animal/plant health measures.
   - **TBT**: Technical standards for trade.
   - **DSU**: Dispute settlement system.
   - **SCM**: Subsidies and countervailing measures.
   - **TFA**: Simplifies customs procedures.

### **Mind Palace Technique:**
   - Imagine a **marketplace** divided into different zones, each representing a specific trade agreement. At the entrance is the **GATT zone** for goods, next to it is the **GATS zone** for services. In the middle, you have the **TRIPS zone**, where ideas (intellectual property) are exchanged. Nearby, the **Agriculture market (AoA)** sells crops with strict rules on subsidies, while the **TRIMS** area ensures fair investment practices. In one corner, there are **food safety inspectors (SPS)**, while the **TBT zone** handles product quality checks. Finally, at the exit, there's a **dispute resolution booth (DSU)** for settling trade issues, and a **fast lane (TFA)** where goods are cleared quickly through customs.

This visualization helps you associate each WTO agreement with specific areas of trade, ensuring that you remember how the WTO governs the global marketplace.
