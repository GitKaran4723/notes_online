# Introduction to WTO

### **World Trade Organization (WTO) - Introduction**

#### 1. **History and Evolution from GATT to WTO**
   - **GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)**: 
     - Established in **1948** after World War II.
     - Aimed at reducing tariffs and other trade barriers to promote international trade.
     - GATT was **not an organization**, but rather a **legal agreement** with a series of trade negotiations (called "rounds").
     - The **Uruguay Round** (1986-1994) was the most significant round and led to the creation of the WTO.
   - **Transformation to WTO**:
     - GATT was limited to goods and had no legal entity to oversee the enforcement of trade rules.
     - The need for a **permanent organization** was recognized to cover not just goods but also services, intellectual property, and to improve dispute resolution.
     - In **1995**, the **World Trade Organization (WTO)** was officially established, replacing GATT.
     - WTO provided a formal institutional framework, covering a wider range of trade issues.

#### 2. **Establishment of WTO**
   - WTO was created by the **Marrakesh Agreement** signed by 123 nations on **1 January 1995**.
   - It became the **global trade organization** responsible for regulating international trade.
   - **Headquarters**: Geneva, Switzerland.
   - **Members**: Initially, 123 member countries; currently, it includes **164 members** (as of 2024).
   - WTO is based on **rules-based multilateral trading system**.

#### 3. **Purpose of the WTO**
   - The WTOâ€™s primary aim is to **ensure smooth, free, and fair international trade**.
   - It provides a platform for:
     - **Negotiating trade agreements**.
     - **Settling trade disputes** among member countries.
     - **Monitoring trade policies**.
   - The organization plays a crucial role in **promoting global economic cooperation**.

#### 4. **Key Functions of WTO**
   - **Trade Negotiation**: Provides a forum for negotiations to reduce barriers to trade (tariffs, quotas, etc.) and create new trade agreements.
   - **Trade Dispute Settlement**: Resolves disputes between member nations through its dispute settlement mechanism.
   - **Monitoring**: Reviews and monitors national trade policies to ensure they adhere to WTO agreements.
   - **Capacity Building for Developing Nations**: Assists developing countries in building their trade capacity through technical assistance and training programs.

#### 5. **Importance of WTO in Global Trade**
   - The WTO **regulates 98% of global trade**.
   - It helps in reducing trade barriers, ensuring that **international trade rules are followed**, promoting **fair competition**, and providing a platform for **resolving trade disputes**.
   - It fosters **economic growth and development** by promoting free and fair trade.

#### **Key Terms to Remember:**
   - **GATT**: Legal agreement for international trade before WTO.
   - **Uruguay Round**: Trade negotiation round that led to WTO.
   - **Marrakesh Agreement**: Established WTO in 1995.
   - **Multilateral Trading System**: A trade system that involves multiple countries adhering to the same set of trade rules.

#### **Mind Palace Technique:**
   - Imagine a **large ship** named "GATT," sailing after World War II, carrying **trade goods** between countries but facing **storms of trade barriers** (tariffs, restrictions). This ship **evolves into a grand, permanent structure**, the WTO, after reaching **Marrakesh**, where a **trade tower** (WTO) is built to **regulate, monitor, and protect global trade**.

By picturing GATT as a ship transforming into the WTO, you'll remember how international trade became more structured and formalized after the establishment of the WTO in 1995.
