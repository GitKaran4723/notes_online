# Structure of WTO

### **World Trade Organization (WTO) - Structure**

The structure of the WTO is designed to manage and oversee the complex global trading system. It provides a framework to handle trade negotiations, disputes, and policy reviews, ensuring that the rules of international trade are followed. Below are the main components of the WTO’s structure:

### 1. **Ministerial Conference**
   - **The highest decision-making body** of the WTO.
   - Meets **at least once every two years**.
   - Composed of representatives (usually ministers responsible for trade) from all **164 member countries**.
   - The Ministerial Conference has the power to take decisions on all matters under any of the WTO agreements.
   - It plays a vital role in **setting the overall agenda**, making high-level decisions on trade policies, and launching new trade negotiations.
   - Recent Ministerial Conferences have dealt with topics such as agricultural subsidies, intellectual property rights, and the development needs of poorer countries.

### 2. **General Council**
   - Operates **continuously** and oversees the day-to-day functions of the WTO.
   - It comprises **ambassadors or permanent representatives** from member countries, based in Geneva.
   - The General Council functions on behalf of the Ministerial Conference and takes care of the day-to-day operations when the Ministerial Conference is not in session.
   - It **meets regularly** to discuss ongoing trade issues, approve membership applications, and handle policy disputes.
   - The General Council also acts in three specialized capacities:
     - **Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)**: Handles trade disputes between countries.
     - **Trade Policy Review Body (TPRB)**: Reviews member countries’ trade policies.
     - **Council for Trade in Goods and Services**: Monitors and facilitates trade in goods and services under different WTO agreements.

### 3. **Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)**
   - A critical component of the WTO’s structure that handles trade disputes between member countries.
   - The DSB is responsible for establishing **dispute resolution panels** and adopting the findings of these panels.
   - It has the authority to accept or reject the reports issued by the **Appellate Body**.
   - When disputes arise between nations over trade agreements or obligations, the DSB helps resolve these conflicts through **consultations, panels, and appeals**.
   - If a country fails to comply with the DSB’s rulings, the DSB can authorize the affected country to impose **retaliatory trade sanctions**.

### 4. **Trade Policy Review Body (TPRB)**
   - The TPRB oversees the **regular review of the trade policies** of individual WTO members.
   - The objective is to ensure **transparency** and adherence to WTO rules, enabling member countries to scrutinize each other’s trade policies.
   - Reviews are conducted based on the economic size of the country:
     - The **four largest traders** (EU, US, Japan, and China) are reviewed **every two years**.
     - The next **16 largest economies** are reviewed every **four years**.
     - Other members are reviewed every **six years**, with some developing nations allowed **longer intervals**.

### 5. **Council for Trade in Goods**
   - This council oversees the implementation of the **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)** and other agreements related to the trade of goods.
   - The Council for Trade in Goods has several specialized committees, such as those dealing with **market access, agriculture, and subsidies**.
   - It ensures that member countries adhere to the rules regarding tariffs, subsidies, and other trade regulations.

### 6. **Council for Trade in Services**
   - This body oversees the implementation of the **General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)**.
   - It handles issues relating to the global **services sector**, such as banking, telecommunications, and tourism.
   - The council ensures that countries follow the agreed rules for trade in services, including issues such as **market access** and **regulations**.

### 7. **Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council)**
   - This council supervises the implementation of the **TRIPS Agreement**.
   - It addresses issues related to the protection of intellectual property (IP) rights, such as **patents, copyrights, trademarks**, and **trade secrets**.
   - The council handles disputes related to intellectual property and its impact on global trade.

### 8. **WTO Secretariat**
   - The **administrative arm** of the WTO, based in **Geneva**.
   - Headed by the **Director-General**, the Secretariat provides technical support for the various councils and committees.
   - It has around **600 staff members** who assist in organizing conferences, maintaining records, and providing legal and technical assistance to member countries.
   - The Director-General plays a key role in **mediating disputes** and overseeing the overall functioning of the WTO.
   - The Secretariat **does not have decision-making powers**; it functions purely as a support body.

### **Key Terms to Remember:**
   - **Ministerial Conference**: The highest decision-making body of the WTO.
   - **General Council**: Oversees day-to-day operations and acts as the dispute resolution body.
   - **Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)**: Resolves trade disputes between member countries.
   - **Trade Policy Review Body (TPRB)**: Ensures transparency by reviewing members’ trade policies.
   - **Secretariat**: Administrative arm of the WTO.

### **Mind Palace Technique:**
   - Imagine a **tall building** with different levels, where each floor represents a key part of the WTO structure. At the **top floor** is the **Ministerial Conference**, where global leaders gather to make high-level decisions. The **General Council** operates from the **middle floors**, continuously managing day-to-day tasks, while the **Dispute Settlement Body** is in a **courtroom-like floor** solving disputes. Below them, the **Trade Policy Review Body** is like a **research and review office**, constantly checking on members' policies. At the **ground floor**, the **Secretariat** is the administrative hub, keeping everything running.

This mind palace helps you visualize the different components of the WTO structure and how they function in maintaining global trade.
