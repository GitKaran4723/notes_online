# Objectives and Functions of SAARC

### **Objectives and Functions of SAARC**

#### **Introduction**
SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) was established on **December 8, 1985**, with the signing of the SAARC Charter in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is a regional intergovernmental organization comprising eight member states: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Its primary goal is to promote regional cooperation and development in South Asia through mutual trust, understanding, and collaboration across various fields.

#### **Objectives of SAARC**

1. **Promote Welfare of People**: 
   SAARC aims to enhance the quality of life and well-being of the people of South Asia. This is achieved by ensuring that economic growth and development directly benefit the regionâ€™s population.

2. **Accelerate Economic Growth and Social Progress**: 
   It seeks to accelerate the pace of economic and social development through cooperation in fields like agriculture, health, education, science, and technology.

3. **Strengthen Collective Self-Reliance**:
   By fostering regional cooperation, SAARC aims to build collective self-reliance among the member nations in various spheres such as trade, technology, and industrial development.

4. **Promote Active Collaboration and Mutual Assistance**:
   SAARC encourages cooperation in economic, social, cultural, technical, and scientific fields to ensure sustainable development across the region. It facilitates member nations to collaborate in addressing common challenges such as poverty, illiteracy, and healthcare.

5. **Promote and Strengthen Cooperation with International and Regional Organizations**:
   SAARC seeks to strengthen cooperation with other regional organizations like ASEAN and international institutions like the United Nations. This helps in addressing transnational issues like climate change, terrorism, and trade facilitation.

#### **Functions of SAARC**

1. **Platform for Dialogue**:
   SAARC provides a platform for member states to discuss, deliberate, and resolve regional issues diplomatically. It aims to facilitate peace and security through dialogue, which is particularly significant given the political tensions in the region, especially between India and Pakistan.

2. **Facilitating Economic and Trade Cooperation**:
   The SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) and South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) are two initiatives to promote intra-regional trade. These frameworks aim to reduce tariffs and trade barriers to enhance the flow of goods and services between member states.

3. **Addressing Social and Human Development Issues**:
   SAARC actively focuses on the development of social sectors such as health, education, and poverty alleviation. The organization implements programs and strategies to combat malnutrition, infant mortality, and communicable diseases.

4. **Disaster Management and Environmental Protection**:
   The region is prone to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones. SAARC works to develop collaborative mechanisms for disaster preparedness, mitigation, and relief. Additionally, it promotes cooperation on environmental conservation and climate change adaptation.

5. **Cultural and Educational Exchange**:
   SAARC aims to enhance people-to-people connectivity by promoting cultural exchange programs, tourism, and education. The SAARC Cultural Centre and SAARC scholarships are notable initiatives to foster cultural and academic cooperation among member nations.

#### **Conclusion**
The objectives and functions of SAARC are primarily focused on promoting regional cooperation, fostering economic development, and addressing collective challenges faced by South Asian nations. However, political tensions and trust deficits, especially between India and Pakistan, often hinder its full potential. Strengthening regional cooperation and mutual understanding among member states is key to achieving the objectives of SAARC.

- **Self-Reliance**: A toolkit symbolizing collective self-reliance.
- **Collaboration**: A handshake between the nations representing cooperation.
