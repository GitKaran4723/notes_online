### Subtopic 3: India’s Role and Strategic Interests in SCO

India’s participation in the **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)** is strategically significant, providing the country with opportunities to engage with both Central Asia and major global powers like China and Russia. Since joining as a full member in **2017**, India has leveraged the platform to promote its economic, security, and geopolitical interests, while also addressing shared regional concerns such as terrorism, economic development, and connectivity.

#### **3.1 Historical Context of India’s Entry into the SCO**

- **Observer Status (2005)**: 
  - India was granted **observer status** in the SCO in **2005**, which allowed it to participate in meetings without having formal voting rights.
  - As an observer, India engaged in discussions related to security, counterterrorism, and economic cooperation but was limited in shaping the organization’s broader policies.

- **Full Membership (2017)**:
  - In **2017**, India, along with **Pakistan**, was granted full membership in the SCO. This marked a significant milestone in India’s foreign policy as it gained access to a platform that engages Central Asian nations, China, and Russia.
  - India’s full membership reflected its growing strategic interest in **Eurasian politics** and its desire to have a greater say in regional security and economic matters.
  - India’s entry into the SCO also provided a counterbalance to China’s influence in the region and helped in developing India’s own regional initiatives.

#### **3.2 Key Areas of Interest for India in SCO**

##### **Security and Counterterrorism Cooperation**
- **Combating Terrorism**: 
  - India has consistently emphasized the need for collective action against **terrorism**, **extremism**, and **radicalization**. India’s focus within the SCO has been to build a unified approach to fight **cross-border terrorism**, particularly from groups in **Afghanistan** and **Pakistan**.
  - India has called for greater **intelligence sharing** and joint anti-terrorism operations through the **Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS)**, to target terror networks and prevent terror financing.

- **Afghanistan Stability**:
  - Stability in **Afghanistan** is critical to India’s security interests, and India has used the SCO platform to address the **post-US withdrawal** situation in Afghanistan.
  - India’s approach focuses on ensuring that Afghanistan does not become a haven for terror groups that could destabilize the region.
  - India has also advocated for a **regional approach** to counter-terrorism, involving not just South and Central Asian countries but also global powers like **Russia** and **China**.

##### **Geopolitical Influence in Central Asia**
- **Engagement with Central Asia**:
  - India’s full membership in the SCO has enhanced its engagement with **Central Asia**, a region that is strategically important for India due to its **energy resources**, **geopolitical position**, and potential for trade.
  - India seeks to improve its **connectivity** with Central Asian countries, bypassing its regional rival **Pakistan**. Initiatives like the **International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)** and **Chabahar Port** aim to create alternative trade routes for India to access Central Asia.

- **Balancing Relations with China**:
  - India’s involvement in the SCO provides it with an opportunity to balance China’s dominance in the region. While India and China are economic competitors and have had military tensions, their participation in the SCO allows them to collaborate on regional stability and economic issues.
  - The SCO provides a platform for **dialogue** between the two countries, helping to reduce tensions, particularly in areas like border disputes and regional security.

##### **Economic Cooperation and Energy Security**
- **Energy Security**:
  - India is highly dependent on energy imports, and **Central Asia’s rich energy resources** (especially natural gas) are crucial for India’s energy security.
  - The SCO offers India access to **Central Asian energy markets** and opportunities for cooperation in sectors like **oil**, **natural gas**, and **renewable energy**. India is interested in participating in **energy infrastructure projects** like gas pipelines, which connect Central Asia to South Asia.

- **Trade and Connectivity**:
  - India sees the SCO as a means to **enhance trade** and **economic cooperation** with Central Asia, Russia, and China. Although current trade levels between India and Central Asia remain relatively low, India aims to use the SCO to increase **market access** and reduce trade barriers.
  - India is promoting regional connectivity projects like the **International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)**, which aims to link **Mumbai** to **Central Asia** via **Iran** and **Russia**, thus reducing shipping costs and time for goods transported between these regions.

##### **Cultural and People-to-People Ties**
- **Cultural Diplomacy**:
  - India has used the SCO platform to foster **cultural exchanges** and enhance **people-to-people ties** with member countries. Through initiatives such as **youth exchange programs**, **scholarships**, and **SCO cultural festivals**, India is strengthening its cultural influence in Central Asia.
  - India’s **Buddhist heritage** and the **shared history** with Central Asian countries create a natural platform for cultural diplomacy, which helps India build long-term relationships with these nations.

- **Educational Cooperation**:
  - India has also promoted **educational cooperation** by offering **scholarships** and educational programs for students from Central Asian countries to study in Indian universities. The focus is on building intellectual and technological ties between the nations.

#### **3.3 India’s Challenges and Opportunities in SCO**

##### **Challenges**:
1. **Relations with Pakistan**:
   - One of the key challenges for India within the SCO is its relationship with **Pakistan**. Both countries are full members, and despite the platform's emphasis on cooperation, India faces difficulties engaging in **counterterrorism dialogue** with Pakistan, as the latter has been accused of supporting cross-border terrorism.
   - The presence of Pakistan in the SCO often leads to friction when discussing security issues, particularly on **terrorism** and regional stability.

2. **China’s Dominance**:
   - While the SCO offers India an opportunity to engage with China on common issues, it also presents challenges due to China’s **dominant position** in the organization. China’s influence, particularly through initiatives like the **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**, which India has opposed, creates tension within the SCO framework.
   - India’s refusal to join the BRI, due to concerns about sovereignty and territorial integrity (related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor), often places it at odds with China on connectivity issues within the SCO.

3. **Low Intra-SCO Trade**:
   - Despite the economic potential of the SCO, **intra-SCO trade** remains underdeveloped, particularly between India and the Central Asian republics. Factors such as **lack of connectivity**, **trade barriers**, and **geopolitical rivalries** (particularly with Pakistan) hinder India’s ability to fully tap into the economic opportunities presented by the SCO.

##### **Opportunities**:
1. **Geopolitical Leverage**:
   - The SCO provides India with a platform to **counterbalance China’s influence** in Eurasia, while also maintaining strong ties with **Russia**. This helps India navigate its complex geopolitical relationships in the region and assert its position as a **regional power**.
   - By engaging in multilateral dialogue with **Russia** and **China**, India can advance its own strategic interests, including border security and regional stability.

2. **Afghan Peace Process**:
   - With Afghanistan as an **observer state** in the SCO, the organization offers India an avenue to play a constructive role in the **Afghan peace process**. As Afghanistan’s stability is crucial to India’s security, India can work within the SCO to ensure that Afghanistan does not become a hub for terrorism.
   - By collaborating with **Russia**, **China**, and **Central Asian states**, India can ensure that any peace settlement in Afghanistan aligns with its strategic interests, particularly concerning **counterterrorism**.

3. **Economic and Energy Cooperation**:
   - The SCO can help India secure **energy resources** from Central Asia, particularly in sectors like **natural gas** and **renewable energy**. Collaboration on energy pipelines, infrastructure projects, and sustainable development initiatives can significantly boost India’s energy security.
   - **Connectivity projects** like the **INSTC** and **Chabahar Port** provide opportunities for India to access Central Asian markets, bypassing Pakistan and engaging directly with Eurasia.
