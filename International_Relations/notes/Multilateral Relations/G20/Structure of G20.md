# Structure of G20

### Topic: **Structure of G20**

The G20 operates through a well-defined structure that facilitates cooperation among the world's major economies. This structure allows for the participation of a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, and civil society, in addressing global economic challenges.

#### 1. **G20 Leaders' Summit**
The annual **Leaders’ Summit** is the highest decision-making body of the G20, where heads of state or government from member countries meet to discuss major global issues and set the G20 agenda. The summit focuses on key economic, financial, and development issues.

- **Participants**: Leaders of G20 countries, invited heads of non-member countries, representatives from major international organizations (like the IMF, World Bank, United Nations, WTO), and other key regional organizations.
- **Objective**: At each summit, leaders discuss a range of topics and commit to actions to improve the global economy, climate change efforts, trade, and other issues.

#### 2. **Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors**
Before the annual summit, meetings of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors are held multiple times a year. These meetings play a crucial role in monitoring the global economy and coordinating economic policies.

- **Role**: Finance ministers and central bank governors focus on financial and economic issues such as macroeconomic stability, global growth, financial regulation, taxation, and international trade.
- **Implementation**: They also oversee the implementation of decisions taken at the Leaders' Summit.

#### 3. **Working Groups**
To focus on specific issues, the G20 has various **Working Groups**. These groups consist of experts from member countries who meet throughout the year to conduct research, make recommendations, and prepare discussion points for the larger G20 meetings.

- **Examples of Working Groups**:
  - **Sustainable Finance Working Group**: Focuses on aligning financial systems with sustainability goals.
  - **Digital Economy Working Group**: Deals with issues related to the digital transformation of economies.
  - **Development Working Group**: Works on promoting sustainable development in low-income countries.
  - **Climate Sustainability Working Group**: Addresses climate change, environmental sustainability, and related policies.

#### 4. **Ministerial Meetings**
In addition to the Leaders' Summit and Finance Ministers' Meetings, the G20 organizes several other **ministerial-level meetings** throughout the year, where ministers from specific sectors gather to discuss targeted issues.

- **Examples of Ministerial Meetings**:
  - **Trade and Investment Ministers Meeting**: Discusses policies for promoting international trade and investment.
  - **Health Ministers Meeting**: Focuses on global health issues, such as responses to pandemics and improving health systems.
  - **Agriculture Ministers Meeting**: Tackles global food security, agricultural development, and sustainable farming practices.
  
These meetings ensure that the G20’s agenda remains broad and inclusive, addressing various global challenges.

#### 5. **G20 Troika**
The **Troika** refers to the group of three countries that are responsible for ensuring continuity in the G20's work. These are:
- **Current Presidency**: The country that holds the G20 presidency in the current year.
- **Previous Presidency**: The country that held the presidency the previous year.
- **Next Presidency**: The country that will hold the presidency in the following year.

The Troika helps ensure consistency in the G20’s work and provides support to the current presidency. It also ensures that the agenda set by one presidency is carried forward and built upon in subsequent years.

#### 6. **Presidency of G20**
The G20 presidency rotates annually among its member countries. The country holding the presidency hosts the annual summit and sets the agenda for the year, focusing on pressing global issues.

- **Duties of the Presidency**:
  - Hosting the Leaders' Summit.
  - Organizing ministerial meetings and working group sessions.
  - Setting the agenda and priorities for the G20 during their term.
  - Promoting the inclusion of new issues or challenges on the G20 agenda.
  
For example, India held the G20 presidency in 2023, focusing on digital transformation, inclusive development, and sustainable growth.

#### 7. **International Organizations and Guest Countries**
Although the G20 consists of only 19 countries and the European Union, it regularly invites other non-member countries and international organizations to participate in its meetings and summits. These participants help broaden the perspectives of discussions and ensure that the interests of smaller or non-member countries are also considered.

- **International Organizations**: Key organizations like the **United Nations (UN)**, **World Trade Organization (WTO)**, **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**, **World Bank**, and **World Health Organization (WHO)** are often invited to provide their input on various global issues.
  
- **Guest Countries**: Each year, the G20 invites a select number of non-member countries to attend the summit. This allows the G20 to include perspectives from different regions of the world.

#### 8. **Engagement Groups**
The G20 recognizes the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives into its discussions. To facilitate this, the G20 has established several **Engagement Groups**, each representing different sectors of society.

- **Business 20 (B20)**: Represents the business community, providing policy recommendations on trade, investment, and economic growth.
- **Civil 20 (C20)**: Represents civil society organizations, contributing to discussions on social, environmental, and developmental issues.
- **Labour 20 (L20)**: Represents labor unions and focuses on employment, decent work conditions, and workers’ rights.
- **Think 20 (T20)**: Represents the global think tank community, providing in-depth research and policy recommendations.
- **Women 20 (W20)**: Promotes gender equality and women’s empowerment within the G20 agenda.
- **Youth 20 (Y20)**: Engages young leaders to provide input on future-focused issues like education, employment, and sustainable development.

#### 9. **Sherpas**
The **Sherpas** are personal representatives of G20 leaders who coordinate the preparations for the annual G20 summit. They engage in negotiations on behalf of their respective leaders and work to finalize the agenda and outcome documents.

- **Role of Sherpas**:
  - Preparing for the Leaders' Summit by negotiating the language of final communiqués and declarations.
  - Coordinating between different working groups, ministerial meetings, and other G20 bodies.
  
Each G20 country has its own Sherpa, who plays a key role in maintaining the smooth functioning of the G20 process throughout the year.
