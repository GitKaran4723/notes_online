### **Mind Palace Technique:**
Imagine a **control room** with seven seats, each representing a G7 country. On one large screen, there is a **map of the world** displaying **economic indicators** like inflation, GDP growth, and trade flows. Another screen shows a **satellite image of the Earth** with rising temperatures and natural disasters to symbolize climate change, while a smaller display highlights **global conflicts** and security threats. In the corner, you see a **digital dashboard** tracking **AI development**, **cybersecurity breaches**, and **innovative tech regulations**. This setup will help you visualize the G7’s role in addressing global economic, political, and technological challenges.

This visualization allows you to see the G7 as a global coordinator, addressing multiple critical issues ranging from economic policy to climate and technology, thereby simplifying the understanding of its broader objectives and role in global governance.
