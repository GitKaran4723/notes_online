#### 9. Mind Palace Technique for Remembering:
To remember the key points of BRICS-BIMSTEC cooperation:
- Imagine a **giant bridge** connecting two islands, one representing **BRICS** (with tall towers marked by economic powerhouses like **India**, **China**, and **Russia**) and the other representing **BIMSTEC** (with smaller, growing economies like **Bangladesh** and **Myanmar**).
- Visualize **trucks** carrying **infrastructure materials**, **energy grids**, and **technology boxes** moving between the two islands, symbolizing trade, energy, and technological cooperation.
- See **tourists** and **security patrols** crossing the bridge, indicating cultural exchanges and security cooperation.
