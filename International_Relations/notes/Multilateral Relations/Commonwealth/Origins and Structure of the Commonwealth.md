## Origins and Structure of the Commonwealth

#### **1.1 Historical Background**

- **Origins**:
  - The **Commonwealth** traces its roots to the **British Empire**, which, at its height, controlled vast territories across Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Pacific.
  - The concept of a modern Commonwealth emerged as the British Empire began to decolonize, providing a platform for former colonies to maintain ties with Britain while gaining independence.
  - The **Statute of Westminster (1931)** marked a key moment in the development of the Commonwealth, as it granted legislative independence to former dominions (e.g., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), allowing them to remain aligned with Britain in a loose association of independent states.
  
- **Formation of the Modern Commonwealth (1949)**:
  - The modern Commonwealth was formally established in **1949** with the **London Declaration**, which redefined the organization. It allowed for the admission of republics and newly independent nations that did not recognize the British monarch as head of state.
  - The Commonwealth thus evolved into a **voluntary association** of independent and sovereign states, no longer bound by allegiance to the British Crown, but united by shared values and goals.
  - India was the first republic to join the Commonwealth under this framework in 1949, establishing a precedent for other newly independent republics to join.

#### **1.2 Structure of the Commonwealth**

##### **Head of the Commonwealth**:
- **Queen Elizabeth II** held the ceremonial title of **Head of the Commonwealth** until her passing in 2022, after which **King Charles III** assumed the role.
