### United Nations Security Council (UNSC) – Detailed Notes

#### 1. Introduction to the UNSC:
- **Establishment**: The UNSC was established in 1945 by the UN Charter as one of the six main organs of the United Nations.
- **Primary Responsibility**: The UNSC's main role is to ensure international peace and security. It has the authority to make binding decisions that member states must comply with.
- **Headquarters**: New York, United States.

#### 2. Membership Structure:
- **Permanent Members**: There are five permanent members of the UNSC, known as the **P5**. These are:
  1. United States
  2. Russian Federation
  3. China
  4. France
  5. United Kingdom
- **Non-Permanent Members**: 
  - The UNSC also consists of ten non-permanent members elected for a two-year term.
  - These members are elected by the General Assembly and are distributed on a regional basis. 
  - The General Assembly elects five new non-permanent members each year.
  - For example, in 2022, **Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, and the UAE** were elected as new non-permanent members, while Estonia, Niger, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia, and Vietnam completed their terms.

#### 3. Voting and Decision-Making:
- **Voting Powers**:
  - Each member of the UNSC has one vote.
  - For any resolution to be passed, nine affirmative votes are needed, including the votes of all five permanent members. 
  - A "no" vote from any permanent member (veto) blocks the resolution.
- **Participation by Non-Members**: Any UN member state that is not part of the UNSC can participate in discussions but cannot vote, especially if the issues discussed affect their interests.

#### 4. India and the UNSC:
- **India’s Involvement**:
  - India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the UNSC eight times. Its most recent term was from **2021-2022**.
  - India has been actively involved in formulating international declarations, such as the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)** in 1948.
  - India has also been a strong advocate against racial discrimination and has played a significant role in maintaining peace in various regions, especially Africa.
- **Contributions to Peacekeeping**:
  - India has participated in 43 peacekeeping missions, contributing more than **160,000 troops** and several police personnel.
  - This makes India one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping operations.
- **India’s Case for Permanent Membership**:
  - India’s demand for permanent membership in the UNSC is justified based on factors such as:
    - Large **population** and territorial size.
    - Significant **GDP** and **economic potential**.
    - **Cultural diversity** and civilisational legacy.
    - India’s consistent contribution to international peace and security.
  - India is also part of the **G4 Group** (India, Brazil, Germany, and Japan) which advocates for reforms in the UNSC.

#### 5. Issues with the UNSC:
1. **Absence of Records and Transparency**:
   - Unlike other UN organs, the UNSC does not maintain detailed records or texts of its deliberations, making its functioning less transparent.
  
2. **Veto Power**:
   - The veto power held by the five permanent members is viewed as outdated and undemocratic. It allows any one of the P5 members to block decisions, even if the majority of the Council supports the resolution.

3. **Divisions within P5**:
   - There is often significant division among the permanent members, particularly between nations like the USA, Russia, and China, which leads to decision-making deadlocks. This has limited the UNSC’s effectiveness in responding to global crises.
   - For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UNSC and other international bodies failed to play an effective role in managing the global response.

4. **Underrepresentation**:
   - Important global players like India, Germany, Brazil, and South Africa remain excluded from the list of permanent members. This underrepresentation reduces the UNSC’s credibility and efficacy in addressing global issues.

#### 6. Way Forward:
1. **Reforming the UNSC**:
   - There is an urgent need to reform the UNSC to address the imbalances in the power structures between the P5 and the rest of the world.
   - Reforms should focus on expanding both permanent and non-permanent memberships to reflect the contemporary global order.
   - **India**, as a non-permanent member, can lead the efforts to draft a comprehensive proposal for reform, collaborating with like-minded nations such as the G4.

2. **Correcting Imbalances**:
   - The structure of the UNSC should be reformed to better represent the geopolitical realities of the 21st century. This includes giving permanent membership to countries like India and other key nations, ensuring that the Council can better respond to modern challenges.

3. **Building Alliances**:
   - India and other G4 members should focus on creating a strong support base within the UN General Assembly to push for UNSC reforms.
   - Engaging in diplomacy with other countries and regional groupings is essential to gain the necessary backing for such proposals.

#### 7. Mind Palace Technique for Remembering:
To remember the key points, use the following imagery:
- Imagine a **round table** in a grand **hall in New York** where 15 members (5 wearing **golden crowns** to signify permanent members and 10 with **rotating colored shields**) are discussing global peace.
- Picture India standing near the table holding a **peacekeeping flag** with the number **43** on it, symbolizing its missions.
- Imagine each of the permanent members (P5) with a **giant veto stamp** in their hands, emphasizing their special power.
- To recall the reform needs, picture **four empty chairs** labeled **India, Germany, Brazil, and South Africa** next to the round table, symbolizing the need for their inclusion in the UNSC.
