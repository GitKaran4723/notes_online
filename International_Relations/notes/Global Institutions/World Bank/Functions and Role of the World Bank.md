### **Mind Palace Technique:**
Imagine the World Bank as a **global construction company**, with its headquarters dedicated to designing projects aimed at **reducing poverty**. On one floor, there are **loan officers** drafting financial packages for building roads and hospitals (loans and grants), while another floor is occupied by **policy experts** advising countries on education and healthcare reforms (policy advice and technical assistance). On the top floor is a **monitoring room**, where analysts are tracking the success of projects (monitoring). Around the building, you see teams working on **environmentally sustainable projects** (sustainable development) and **crisis response units** ready to act when disasters strike.

This visualization helps connect the World Bank’s core functions—financing, advising, capacity building, project monitoring, and crisis response—illustrating how the institution helps countries achieve sustainable growth and reduce poverty.
