      - Role: IDA assistance is often focused on **human capital development**, helping countries meet **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

   3. **International Finance Corporation (IFC)**:

      - Purpose: It aims to **promote private investment** in industries that are vital for economic growth, such as **manufacturing**, **infrastructure**, and **technology**.

      - Purpose: Its role is to **reduce the risks** associated with investing in unstable regions, such as expropriation, war, or political unrest.

### b) **Leadership and Governance**
   - The **President of the World Bank** is the chief executive officer and is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the organization. The President is selected by the **Board of Governors** and traditionally comes from the United States.
   - The governance of the World Bank is structured around two main bodies:
     
     1. **Board of Governors**:
        - Consists of one governor from each of the 189 member countries, typically the country’s **finance minister** or **central bank governor**.
        - The Board of Governors meets annually to decide on key issues like new policies, financial commitments, and the appointment of the World Bank president.
     
     2. **Board of Executive Directors**:
        - Made up of 25 Executive Directors who represent the member countries. Some countries, such as the US, Japan, China, Germany, and the UK, have their own representatives, while other countries are grouped together and represented collectively.
        - The Executive Directors meet regularly to review the **Bank’s projects**, **policies**, and **financial operations**. They have a key role in approving projects and loans.

   - The **World Bank President** works closely with the Board of Executive Directors and oversees the day-to-day operations of the organization, guiding the institution in its mission to reduce poverty and promote economic growth.

### c) **Membership and Voting Power**
   - The World Bank currently has **189 member countries**, all of which are shareholders in the organization.
   - Membership in the World Bank requires countries to also be members of the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**.
   - Voting power in the World Bank is based on a system of **weighted voting**. This means that votes are distributed according to the **financial contributions** of each member country. Wealthier countries with larger economies contribute more capital to the World Bank and, as a result, hold more voting power.
   - The **United States** is the largest single shareholder, followed by Japan, China, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This weighted voting system gives these countries more influence over the Bank’s decisions.

### d) **World Bank Operations**
   - The World Bank primarily provides **loans, grants, and technical assistance** for projects aimed at reducing poverty and promoting economic development.
   - It operates through the **IBRD** and **IDA**, which work with governments to finance infrastructure projects, policy reforms, and capacity-building initiatives.
   - Projects are typically initiated by the borrowing countries but require the approval of the Board of Executive Directors.
   - The World Bank also offers **technical expertise**, **policy advice**, and **capacity-building** services to help countries strengthen their institutions, manage debt, and improve governance.

### e) **Regional and Sectoral Focus**
   - The World Bank operates through regional offices in **Africa**, **East Asia and the Pacific**, **Europe and Central Asia**, **Latin America and the Caribbean**, **Middle East and North Africa**, and **South Asia**.
   - Each region has its unique set of challenges, and the World Bank tailors its assistance to address regional and sectoral needs, including **energy**, **education**, **transportation**, **water and sanitation**, **public health**, and **agriculture**.
   - The **sectoral focus** of the World Bank spans areas such as **climate change**, **gender equality**, **digital economy**, and **fragile and conflict-affected states**.
