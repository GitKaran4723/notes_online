   - The overarching goal is to achieve **sustainable development** and foster economic growth, thus improving living conditions in low- and middle-income countries.

### b) **World Bank Group (WBG)**
   - The World Bank itself is part of a larger entity called the **World Bank Group (WBG)**, which consists of **five institutions** that work together to provide financial products, policy advice, and technical assistance to developing countries. These five institutions are:
     1. **International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)** – Provides loans to middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries.
     2. **International Development Association (IDA)** – Offers concessional loans and grants to the world’s poorest countries.
     3. **International Finance Corporation (IFC)** – Focuses on private sector development by providing loans and equity investments.

### **Mind Palace Technique:**
Imagine a **large construction site**, representing post-World War II rebuilding. In the middle of the site is a **capital vault**, symbolizing the World Bank’s funding sources. Surrounding the vault are **five cranes** (representing the five arms of the World Bank Group), each one working on different parts of development—**infrastructure**, **education**, **private sector** growth, and **risk management**. At the head of the construction site is a **director’s chair**, representing the **World Bank President**, overseeing the operations.
