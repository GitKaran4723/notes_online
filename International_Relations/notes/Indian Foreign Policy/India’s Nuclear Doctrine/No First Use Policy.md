### India's Nuclear Doctrine: "No First Use Policy"

**1. Introduction to No First Use (NFU) Policy:**
   - **Definition**: The No First Use policy is a commitment by a nuclear-armed state to not use nuclear weapons as a means of warfare unless first attacked by an adversary using nuclear weapons.
   - **India’s Stance**: India has officially adopted the No First Use (NFU) policy as a cornerstone of its nuclear doctrine. This policy was first articulated in India’s nuclear doctrine, which was drafted after India conducted its nuclear tests in 1998.

**2. Historical Context:**
   - **Post-Pokhran-II Tests (1998)**: India declared itself a nuclear-armed state after the Pokhran-II tests. Shortly after these tests, India formulated a draft nuclear doctrine in 1999, which emphasized the NFU policy.
   - **Formalization in 2003**: India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) formally adopted the nuclear doctrine in 2003, reaffirming the NFU policy.

**3. Key Features of India’s NFU Policy:**
   - **Retaliatory Strike Only**: India pledges not to use nuclear weapons first but maintains the right to retaliate with massive nuclear retaliation in response to a nuclear attack on Indian territory or on Indian forces anywhere.
   - **Survivability of Second Strike Capability**: India’s doctrine emphasizes maintaining a credible minimum deterrent with a second-strike capability, ensuring that India can respond effectively even after absorbing a first strike.
   - **Non-Use Against Non-Nuclear States**: India’s nuclear doctrine also includes a pledge not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states, reinforcing its commitment to non-aggression and responsible nuclear stewardship.

**4. Strategic Rationale:**
   - **Deterrence**: The NFU policy is rooted in the principle of deterrence, where the threat of massive retaliation is intended to deter adversaries from considering a nuclear strike against India.
   - **International Image**: By adopting NFU, India projects itself as a responsible nuclear power, committed to reducing the risks of nuclear conflict and promoting global nuclear disarmament.
   - **Strategic Stability**: NFU contributes to strategic stability in South Asia by reducing the chances of a nuclear arms race and lowering the risk of a preemptive strike in a crisis scenario.

**5. Debates and Challenges:**
   - **Credibility and Ambiguity**: There is ongoing debate within India and among international observers about the credibility of India’s NFU policy. Some argue that ambiguity in the policy might enhance deterrence, while others believe it might undermine it.
   - **Changing Security Dynamics**: Some policymakers and analysts have called for a review of the NFU policy in light of changing security dynamics, including advancements in missile technology and the evolving nature of threats from neighboring countries like Pakistan and China.
   - **Potential for Revision**: While the NFU policy remains officially in place, there have been occasional statements from Indian officials suggesting that India’s nuclear doctrine, including NFU, could be reviewed if security conditions change.

**6. Global Perspective:**
   - **Comparison with Other Nuclear States**: Unlike India, not all nuclear-armed states have adopted a NFU policy. For example, the United States and Russia have reserved the right to use nuclear weapons first in certain scenarios, reflecting different strategic doctrines.
   - **Impact on Global Nuclear Norms**: India’s NFU policy contributes to global nuclear norms by promoting the idea that nuclear weapons should primarily serve as a deterrent and not be used as tools of aggression.

**7. Conclusion:**
   - **Continued Commitment**: As of now, India continues to uphold its NFU policy, which remains a key element of its nuclear strategy. The policy is integral to India’s broader approach to national security, deterrence, and international diplomacy.
   - **Future Considerations**: The future of India’s NFU policy may depend on regional security developments and technological advancements. However, any shift from the NFU stance would have significant implications for South Asian security and global nuclear strategy.
