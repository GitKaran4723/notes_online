### **What is Nuclear Policy?**

Nuclear policy refers to a set of guidelines, principles, and strategies that a country follows regarding its **nuclear weapons** and **nuclear energy** programs. It covers:
- **Development, deployment, and use of nuclear weapons.**
- **Prevention of proliferation** (spreading of nuclear technology) and accidental use.
- **Safe development of nuclear energy** for civilian purposes.

Nuclear energy provides a clean and reliable source of power but also carries risks like accidents and the potential misuse of nuclear technology for weapons.

### **Evolution of India’s Nuclear Policy and Programmes**

India's nuclear policy and programmes have evolved since independence in two distinct phases:

#### 1. **Passive Phase (Late 1940s - 1974)**
This phase focused on building the foundation of India’s nuclear capabilities, primarily for peaceful purposes.

| Year  | Event |
|-------|-------|
| **1945** | Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) was established by Homi J. Bhabha for research in fundamental sciences. |
| **1948** | Atomic Energy Commission of India (AEC) was set up to formulate and implement nuclear policy. |
| **1951** | First uranium deposit was discovered in Singhbhum district, Jharkhand. |
| **1954** | Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was created for developing nuclear power and radiation technologies. |
| **1957** | Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET), later renamed BARC, was established for nuclear research. |
| **1963** | The USA and India signed an accord for the USA to supply enriched fuel to India’s Tarapur power plant. |
| **1970** | Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) came into force, which India did not sign due to concerns about its discriminatory nature. |
| **1974** | India conducted its first nuclear test (Operation Smiling Buddha) at Pokhran, Rajasthan. |

---

#### 2. **Active Phase (1974 Onwards)**
India took decisive steps to advance its nuclear weapons program and peaceful nuclear energy.

| Year  | Event |
|-------|-------|
| **1974** | Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was established to prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials. |
| **1987** | Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) was established to generate electricity from nuclear power. |
| **1988** | Pakistan and India signed a non-attack agreement on nuclear installations. |
| **1998** | India conducted Operation Shakti (Pokhran-II), a series of nuclear tests. |
| **2003** | India’s **Nuclear Doctrine** and **Nuclear Command Authority (NCA)** were established, formalizing India’s nuclear strategy. |
| **2009** | India launched its first nuclear-powered submarine, INS Arihant. |
| **2016** | India completed its **Nuclear Triad** capability, i.e., the ability to launch nuclear weapons from land, air, and sea. |

### **India’s Three-Stage Nuclear Power Programme**

India's nuclear energy programme aims for self-reliance, with three distinct stages:

| **Stage** | **Aim** | **Fuel** | **Nuclear Reactor** |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Stage 1** | Establish domestic nuclear power infrastructure. | Uranium | Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs). |
| **Stage 2** | Develop self-sustaining nuclear fuel cycle. | Plutonium | Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs). |
| **Stage 3** | Achieve complete energy independence. | Thorium | Advanced Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs). |

### **Key Elements of India’s Nuclear Doctrine**

| **Principle**                        | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No First Use (NFU)**               | India will not use nuclear weapons unless first attacked with nuclear weapons.   |
| **Credible Minimum Deterrence**      | India will maintain a small but sufficient nuclear arsenal for deterrence.       |
| **Retaliation Only**                 | Nuclear weapons will only be used in retaliation for a nuclear attack.           |
| **Last Resort**                      | Nuclear weapons are considered a last resort when all other options have failed. |
| **Non-use against Non-Nuclear States** | India will not use nuclear weapons against countries without nuclear weapons.    |
| **No Use Against Civilians**         | India pledges not to target civilians with nuclear weapons.                      |
| **Commitment to Disarmament**        | India supports global efforts for nuclear disarmament.                           |

---

### **Significant International Agreements and Events**

| **Year** | **Event** |
|----------|-----------|
| **2008** | **India-USA Civil Nuclear Agreement** (123 Agreement) allowed cooperation in civil nuclear technology. |
| **2016** | **India-Japan Civil Nuclear Agreement** for nuclear cooperation in technology and safety. |
| **2016** | India completed its Nuclear Triad by launching nuclear missiles from land, air, and sea. |

### **Should India Review its ‘No First Use’ (NFU) Policy?**

There are arguments for and against reviewing the NFU policy:

#### **Arguments to Review NFU:**
- **Changed Security Environment:** South Asia has evolved, and India faces new threats from state and non-state actors.
- **Strategic Interests:** India’s doctrine should adapt to its growing military capabilities and geopolitical realities.

#### **Arguments to Maintain NFU:**
- **Deterrence Stability:** The NFU policy has worked well for India, helping avoid nuclear arms races in the region.
- **Global Reputation:** Abandoning NFU may damage India’s standing in the international community and escalate tensions.

### **The Way Forward for India’s Nuclear Policy**

India's nuclear policy should focus on the following:

1. **Nuclear Disarmament**: Continue diplomatic efforts for global nuclear disarmament.
2. **Non-Proliferation**: Strengthen international non-proliferation efforts and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons technology.
3. **Nuclear Energy Development**: Expand the civilian nuclear energy program to meet growing energy needs while ensuring safety.
4. **Regional Security**: Maintain a policy of deterrence and engage with neighbors to reduce tensions and promote stability.

### **Mind Palace Technique for Remembering Key Concepts:**

- **Room 1:** A desk labeled **Nuclear Doctrine** with a map of India’s deterrence strategy. The **No First Use** policy and other key principles (Retaliation, Minimum Deterrence) are displayed as guides.
  
- **Room 2:** Another desk labeled **Nuclear Policy** with documents on energy development, international agreements (e.g., India-USA Civil Nuclear Agreement), and India's **three-stage nuclear power programme**.

This visualization helps you separate India's military-focused nuclear doctrine from its broader nuclear policy.
