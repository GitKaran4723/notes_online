**India's Foreign Policy - Determinants, Issues, and Challenges:**

**Introduction:**
India's foreign policy is shaped by several determinants, with key factors being **geography, strategic culture, national requirements and goals, global and regional challenges, and available resources**. Ambassador (Retd) Rajiv Sikri, in a lecture at the Central University of Rajasthan, Ajmer, on February 13, 2017, elaborated on these factors and the challenges India faces in implementing its foreign policy.

**Key Components:**

1. **Geography:**
   - India's geographical position has historically influenced its defensive mindset, leading to challenges in modern foreign policy.
   - The country's fixed borders contrast with the traditionally fluid boundaries of its frontier regions, leading to border disputes, such as with China.
   - India's neighbors, due to their need for sovereignty, often distance themselves from India, complicating regional relations.
   - Despite these challenges, India's strategic location in Asia and its dominance over the Indian Ocean offer significant advantages.

2. **Strategic Culture:**
   - India's strategic culture is rooted in its history of complacency and non-aggression, shaped by centuries of prosperity and invasions.
   - This culture led to a preference for diplomacy and non-violence, especially under leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.
   - Modern India, under Prime Minister Modi, has shifted towards a more assertive and pragmatic foreign policy, seeking global partnerships without compromising its autonomy.

3. **Requirements and Goals:**
   - The primary goal of India's foreign policy is to ensure **national security** and create a peaceful environment conducive to development.
   - Economic factors have become increasingly important, with foreign policy now focused on promoting trade, attracting investment, and ensuring energy security.
   - The **welfare of Indians abroad**, including the large diaspora, is also a significant consideration.

4. **Global and Regional Challenges:**
   - India navigates a complex global landscape marked by shifting power dynamics, with challenges from China, the US, and regional instability.
   - The country aims to assert itself as a leading global power, balancing relationships with major powers while maintaining strategic autonomy.

5. **Resources:**
   - Effective foreign policy requires strong leadership, public support, and adequate resources.
   - Diplomacy remains a **critical tool**, supported by soft power and military capabilities.
   - India's progress in economic and defense capabilities is essential for its foreign policy objectives, with foreign investments and technology playing a crucial role.

**Conclusion:**
India's foreign policy is a complex interplay of historical, geographical, and strategic factors, influenced by both internal and external challenges. The country's approach has evolved over time, with a growing emphasis on economic interests, strategic autonomy, and global partnerships. While significant progress has been made, India continues to face challenges that require careful management of its resources and capabilities.
