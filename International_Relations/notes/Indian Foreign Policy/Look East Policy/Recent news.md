India's **Act East Policy** has seen several recent developments aimed at enhancing its economic, strategic, and cultural engagement with Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. Here are the key updates:

1. **Strategic Focus on Infrastructure and Connectivity**: 
   India is pushing ahead with infrastructure projects to strengthen connectivity with its eastern neighbors. The **Kaladan Multi-modal Transit Transport Project**, aimed at connecting Indiaâ€™s Northeast with Myanmar and beyond, has faced delays due to the internal conflict in Myanmar, but efforts to continue are underway. Similarly, the **India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway**, which seeks to boost trade and economic ties, has been impacted by the security situation in Myanmar [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/amid-unrest-in-neighbors-indias-act-east-policy-faces-new-headwinds/)[PIB](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1810971).

2. **Increased Emphasis on the Northeastern Region**: 
   The Indian government is making the Northeast a critical gateway to its Act East Policy. Efforts are ongoing to develop waterways and improve infrastructure in this region, connecting it more effectively with Southeast Asian nations. Notably, the development of **National Waterways 2 and 16** is part of India's strategy to boost trade with Bangladesh and Myanmar via inland water transport[PIB](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1810971).

3. **Challenges in Neighboring Countries**: 
   The policy has encountered challenges due to political instability in neighboring countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh. The civil war in Myanmar and recent political changes in Bangladesh have strained cross-border initiatives, impacting security and cooperation in the region[The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/amid-unrest-in-neighbors-indias-act-east-policy-faces-new-headwinds/).

4. **Strategic Partnerships**: 
   India continues to strengthen its partnerships with countries like **Vietnam**, **Japan**, and **South Korea** under the Act East framework. These partnerships are crucial for counterbalancing China's growing influence in the region [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-focuses-on-act-east-policy-in-first-100-days-of-modi-30-101725611651607.html).

In summary, while the Act East Policy has seen notable progress, geopolitical challenges in neighboring countries and security concerns in Myanmar have slowed down some key initiatives. Nonetheless, India is continuing to push for deeper engagement through infrastructure development, strategic partnerships, and increased focus on the Northeast region as a gateway to Southeast Asia.
