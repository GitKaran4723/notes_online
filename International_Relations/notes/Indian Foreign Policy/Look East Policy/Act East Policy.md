### Look East Policy and Act East Policy: Evolution of India’s Engagement with East and Southeast Asia

**1. Introduction to the Look East Policy:**
   - **Definition**: The Look East Policy was an initiative launched by the Government of India in the early 1990s to strengthen economic and strategic relations with the countries of East and Southeast Asia. The policy marked a significant shift in India’s foreign policy, focusing on enhancing engagement with the dynamic economies of this region.
   - **Launch**: The policy was initiated by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in 1991, in response to the changing global and regional geopolitical landscape following the end of the Cold War and the economic liberalization of India.

**2. Historical Context:**
   - **Pre-1991 Foreign Policy**: Prior to the Look East Policy, India’s foreign relations were largely focused on the Non-Aligned Movement, the Soviet Union, and its immediate neighbors in South Asia. Relations with East and Southeast Asia were relatively underdeveloped.
   - **Post-Cold War Environment**: The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War necessitated a reorientation of India’s foreign policy. At the same time, India was undergoing economic liberalization, which required new markets and investment opportunities. The Look East Policy was born out of these needs.
   - **Economic Growth in East Asia**: The rapid economic growth of East and Southeast Asian countries, particularly the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members, made them attractive partners for trade, investment, and strategic cooperation.

**3. Objectives of the Look East Policy:**
   - **Economic Integration**: The primary objective was to integrate India’s economy with the rapidly growing economies of East and Southeast Asia. This involved increasing trade, investment, and economic cooperation with countries in the region.
   - **Strategic Partnerships**: The policy aimed to build strategic partnerships with countries in East and Southeast Asia to enhance regional security and stability. This included cooperation in areas such as defense, counter-terrorism, and maritime security.
   - **Cultural and Diplomatic Engagement**: Strengthening cultural ties and diplomatic relations was also a key objective. India sought to revive historical and cultural links with the region, which had been neglected during the Cold War period.

**4. Implementation of the Look East Policy:**
   - **Phase I (1991-2000)**: The initial phase focused on building economic and trade relationships. India became a sectoral dialogue partner with ASEAN in 1992 and a full dialogue partner in 1996. The focus was on economic diplomacy, with limited strategic engagement.
   - **Phase II (2000-2014)**: The second phase saw a deepening of both economic and strategic ties. India became a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and participated in the East Asia Summit (EAS). Defense and security cooperation with ASEAN countries and other East Asian nations increased significantly during this period.

**5. Transition to Act East Policy:**
   - **Launch of Act East Policy**: In 2014, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Look East Policy was upgraded to the Act East Policy. This marked a more proactive and assertive approach to engaging with East and Southeast Asia.
   - **Focus on Action**: The Act East Policy emphasized not just looking towards the East but actively engaging with the region across multiple dimensions—economic, strategic, cultural, and people-to-people contacts.
   - **Strategic Dimension**: The Act East Policy placed a stronger emphasis on strategic and defense cooperation, particularly in the context of China’s growing influence in the region. This includes deepening ties with key countries such as Japan, Vietnam, Australia, and the United States, and participating in multilateral security initiatives like the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue).
   - **Connectivity and Infrastructure**: There was also a renewed focus on enhancing physical and digital connectivity with Southeast Asia, through initiatives like the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project.

**6. Key Components of the Act East Policy:**
   - **Economic Diplomacy**: Continued emphasis on boosting trade and investment with ASEAN countries, Japan, South Korea, and other East Asian nations. India has sought to enhance its role in regional economic frameworks, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), although it eventually chose not to join the agreement due to concerns about its impact on domestic industries.
   - **Defense and Security Cooperation**: The Act East Policy has led to increased defense collaboration, including joint military exercises, defense technology sharing, and strategic dialogues with countries in the region. The focus is on ensuring a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.
   - **Cultural Exchange and Soft Power**: Expanding cultural exchanges, educational ties, and tourism between India and East/Southeast Asia. The policy also leverages India’s cultural heritage, including Buddhism and shared historical connections, to strengthen ties.
   - **Multilateral Engagement**: India’s participation in regional and multilateral forums, such as the ASEAN-India Summit, East Asia Summit, and ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus), has been a key feature of the Act East Policy.

**7. Achievements of the Act East Policy:**
   - **Strengthened Strategic Partnerships**: India has significantly strengthened its strategic partnerships with Japan, Australia, Vietnam, and ASEAN countries. This has included enhanced defense cooperation and strategic dialogues on regional security issues.
   - **Increased Trade and Investment**: Trade and investment flows between India and East/Southeast Asia have increased, with ASEAN now being one of India’s largest trading partners. Various free trade agreements (FTAs) and economic cooperation agreements have been signed or are under negotiation.
   - **Enhanced Regional Connectivity**: The focus on connectivity has led to progress in infrastructure projects aimed at improving links between India and Southeast Asia. This is crucial for boosting trade, tourism, and people-to-people ties.

**8. Challenges and Criticisms:**
   - **China’s Influence**: The growing influence of China in East and Southeast Asia, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), poses a challenge to India’s Act East Policy. India’s efforts to counterbalance China’s influence in the region are an ongoing strategic challenge.
   - **Economic Integration**: While trade with ASEAN has increased, India’s decision to opt out of RCEP highlighted the challenges of deeper economic integration. Concerns over trade imbalances and the impact on domestic industries continue to pose hurdles.
   - **Infrastructure and Connectivity**: Despite progress, several infrastructure and connectivity projects have faced delays and challenges, limiting the full realization of the Act East Policy’s objectives.
   - **Bureaucratic Hurdles**: Implementation of policy initiatives has sometimes been hampered by bureaucratic delays and coordination challenges between various government departments.

**9. Future Prospects:**
   - **Deepening Engagement**: The future of the Act East Policy will likely involve deepening economic, strategic, and cultural engagement with East and Southeast Asia. India will continue to focus on building robust partnerships to promote regional stability and development.
   - **Indo-Pacific Strategy**: The Act East Policy will be increasingly linked to India’s broader Indo-Pacific strategy, which aims to ensure a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, with a focus on maritime security and rule-based order.
   - **Leveraging Multilateral Forums**: India will likely continue to play an active role in regional and multilateral forums to enhance its influence and promote regional cooperation in areas such as trade, security, and climate change.

**10. Conclusion:**
   - **Strategic Importance**: The Act East Policy is a critical component of India’s foreign policy, reflecting the strategic importance of East and Southeast Asia in India’s geopolitical and economic calculations.
   - **Proactive Approach**: By transitioning from the Look East to the Act East Policy, India has adopted a more proactive approach to its engagement with the region, seeking to play a larger role in shaping the regional security architecture and economic landscape.
   - **Continued Relevance**: As geopolitical dynamics in the Indo-Pacific evolve, the Act East Policy will continue to be a cornerstone of India’s foreign policy, adapting to new challenges and opportunities in the region.
