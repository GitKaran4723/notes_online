### Neighbourhood First Policy: Evolution of India’s Neighbourhood Policy

**1. Introduction to the Neighbourhood First Policy:**
   - **Definition**: The Neighbourhood First Policy is a strategic initiative of India aimed at prioritizing its relations with neighboring countries in South Asia. The policy emphasizes the importance of fostering strong, cooperative, and mutually beneficial ties with India's immediate neighbors.
   - **Launch and Focus**: This policy was officially articulated after the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. It seeks to strengthen economic, political, security, and cultural ties with neighboring countries, focusing on regional stability and development.

**2. Historical Context:**
   - **Early Years of Independent India**: India’s initial foreign policy, under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, focused on non-alignment and global peace. Relations with neighbors were influenced by the partition of India, the creation of Pakistan, and regional conflicts.
   - **Cold War Era**: During the Cold War, India’s relations with its neighbors were shaped by superpower rivalry, regional conflicts, and internal political dynamics. India's focus on global issues sometimes led to less emphasis on immediate neighbors.
   - **Post-Cold War Period**: The end of the Cold War and economic liberalization in the 1990s led to a shift in India’s foreign policy, with greater emphasis on regional cooperation and economic integration. However, relationships with neighbors like Pakistan and China remained complex and often tense.

**3. Evolution into the Neighbourhood First Policy:**
   - **Economic and Security Considerations**: By the early 21st century, India recognized the need to focus on its immediate neighborhood to ensure regional stability and security. Economic integration, infrastructure development, and connectivity became key components of this policy.
   - **Shift in 2014**: With Narendra Modi's government coming to power in 2014, the Neighbourhood First Policy was formalized as a key pillar of India’s foreign policy. The policy reflects a more proactive and engaged approach to the region.

**4. Objectives of the Neighbourhood First Policy:**
   - **Strengthening Bilateral Ties**: The policy aims to strengthen bilateral relations with all neighboring countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, and Afghanistan, with a focus on mutual respect and benefits.
   - **Regional Security and Stability**: Ensuring regional stability through cooperative security arrangements, counter-terrorism efforts, and crisis management is a key objective. The policy seeks to address common security challenges, including cross-border terrorism and insurgencies.
   - **Economic Integration and Connectivity**: Enhancing trade, investment, and economic cooperation is central to the policy. India has invested in infrastructure projects, energy cooperation, and trade facilitation to promote regional economic integration.
   - **Cultural and People-to-People Ties**: The policy emphasizes cultural diplomacy and people-to-people connections through initiatives like educational exchanges, cultural festivals, and tourism promotion.
   - **Humanitarian Assistance**: India has provided humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to its neighbors, strengthening ties through timely support during natural disasters and crises.

**5. Key Initiatives under the Neighbourhood First Policy:**
   - **SAARC and BIMSTEC Engagement**: India has actively engaged with regional organizations like SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) and BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) to promote regional cooperation.
   - **Infrastructure Projects**: Major infrastructure projects include the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project in Myanmar, and cross-border electricity grids with Nepal and Bhutan.
   - **Visa Liberalization**: Efforts to simplify visa processes for neighboring countries have been undertaken to promote tourism, business travel, and people-to-people interactions.
   - **Disaster Relief**: India has provided significant disaster relief to neighbors, such as during the 2015 Nepal earthquake and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, enhancing its role as a regional leader in humanitarian assistance.

**6. Challenges to the Neighbourhood First Policy:**
   - **Geopolitical Rivalries**: India’s efforts are often challenged by geopolitical rivalries, particularly with China’s growing influence in the region through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Competition with China affects India’s relations with countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.
   - **Pakistan Relations**: Relations with Pakistan remain a significant challenge, marked by border conflicts, terrorism, and differing views on regional security. The lack of progress in India-Pakistan relations impacts the broader success of the Neighbourhood First Policy.
   - **Internal Political Dynamics**: Domestic politics in neighboring countries sometimes complicate bilateral relations. Changes in government, political instability, and nationalist sentiments can affect the implementation of cooperative projects.

**7. Achievements and Impact:**
   - **Improved Bilateral Relations**: The policy has led to improved relations with several neighbors, particularly Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Joint initiatives in trade, infrastructure, and security have strengthened these ties.
   - **Regional Leadership**: India’s proactive engagement has reinforced its role as a regional leader, with several neighbors viewing India as a key partner in their development and security.
   - **Increased Connectivity**: Enhanced physical and digital connectivity between India and its neighbors has facilitated trade, tourism, and cultural exchange, contributing to regional economic growth.

**8. Future Outlook:**
   - **Deepening Engagement**: The future of the Neighbourhood First Policy lies in deepening engagement with neighboring countries, addressing mutual concerns, and ensuring that development and security are shared responsibilities.
   - **Balancing Geopolitical Challenges**: India will need to carefully navigate its relations with China and other regional powers to ensure the continued success of the Neighbourhood First Policy.
   - **Inclusive Regional Cooperation**: The policy will likely continue to emphasize inclusive regional cooperation, encouraging all South Asian countries to participate in and benefit from collective growth and stability initiatives.

**9. Conclusion:**
   - **Strategic Importance**: The Neighbourhood First Policy remains a cornerstone of India’s foreign policy, reflecting the strategic importance of maintaining stable, prosperous, and cooperative relations with its immediate neighbors.
   - **Dynamic Approach**: The policy is likely to evolve in response to changing regional dynamics, but its core principles of prioritizing neighborhood relations and regional stability will continue to guide India’s foreign policy efforts.
