### Gujral Doctrine: India’s Foreign Policy Framework

**1. Introduction to the Gujral Doctrine:**
   - **Definition**: The Gujral Doctrine is a set of five principles formulated by I.K. Gujral, who served as India’s Minister of External Affairs (1996-1997) and later as the Prime Minister (1997-1998). The doctrine emphasizes India's approach to its neighbors, advocating for unilateral concessions and a non-reciprocal stance to foster better relations.
   - **Objective**: The doctrine aimed to improve India’s relations with its smaller neighbors by addressing their concerns and enhancing regional cooperation and stability.

**2. Historical Context:**
   - **Post-Cold War Dynamics**: The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a shift in global power dynamics. India, which had been closely aligned with the Soviet Union, needed to reassess its foreign policy.
   - **South Asian Relations**: During the 1990s, India’s relations with its South Asian neighbors were strained due to various historical and political issues. The Gujral Doctrine emerged as a response to these challenges, focusing on improving ties with neighboring countries.
   - **I.K. Gujral’s Vision**: I.K. Gujral believed that India, as the largest and most powerful country in South Asia, had a special responsibility to ensure regional peace and stability. He argued that India should take the initiative in building trust and cooperation with its neighbors.

**3. The Five Principles of the Gujral Doctrine:**
   - **Principle 1: No Reciprocity Required**: India would not demand reciprocity from its smaller neighbors, meaning that India would make unilateral concessions to its neighbors without expecting anything in return. This principle was intended to build trust and goodwill.
   - **Principle 2: Respect for Sovereignty**: India would respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors, refraining from interfering in their internal affairs. This principle sought to address concerns about India’s perceived dominance in the region.
   - **Principle 3: Non-Interference**: India would not allow its territory to be used for activities that could harm the interests of its neighbors. This principle was particularly relevant in the context of cross-border terrorism and insurgencies.
   - **Principle 4: Resolution of Disputes**: India would resolve all bilateral disputes with its neighbors through peaceful means, focusing on dialogue and negotiation rather than coercion or force.
   - **Principle 5: Promoting Economic Cooperation**: India would actively promote regional economic cooperation, encouraging trade, investment, and development initiatives that would benefit all countries in the region.

**4. Implementation and Impact:**
   - **Sri Lanka**: The Gujral Doctrine was applied in India’s approach to the civil war in Sri Lanka. India refrained from intervening directly in the conflict and focused on providing humanitarian assistance and facilitating peace talks.
   - **Bangladesh**: India improved its relations with Bangladesh by resolving long-standing disputes, including the Ganges water-sharing agreement of 1996, which was a significant achievement under the Gujral Doctrine.
   - **Nepal**: The doctrine influenced India’s relations with Nepal, where India supported democratic processes and economic development while respecting Nepal’s sovereignty and independence.
   - **Bhutan and Maldives**: India strengthened its ties with Bhutan and the Maldives through economic aid, infrastructure development, and educational exchanges, without imposing conditions or seeking reciprocal benefits.
   - **Pakistan**: The application of the Gujral Doctrine to Pakistan was more challenging due to the historical animosity and ongoing conflicts, particularly over Kashmir. However, Gujral sought to engage with Pakistan through dialogue and confidence-building measures.

**5. Challenges and Criticisms:**
   - **Lack of Reciprocity**: Critics of the Gujral Doctrine argued that the lack of reciprocity made India appear weak and did not necessarily lead to the desired improvements in relations. Some believed that India’s unilateral concessions could be exploited by its neighbors.
   - **Security Concerns**: The doctrine’s emphasis on non-interference and peaceful resolution of disputes was seen by some as overly idealistic, particularly in the context of security threats from Pakistan and cross-border terrorism.
   - **Limited Longevity**: The Gujral Doctrine was closely associated with I.K. Gujral’s tenure in office, and its influence waned after he left power. Subsequent governments did not fully embrace the doctrine, and India’s foreign policy shifted towards a more pragmatic and reciprocal approach.

**6. Legacy of the Gujral Doctrine:**
   - **Foundation for Future Policies**: Despite its criticisms, the Gujral Doctrine laid the groundwork for India’s future neighborhood policies. It underscored the importance of building trust and cooperation with neighbors, a principle that continues to influence India’s foreign policy.
   - **Influence on Neighbourhood First Policy**: The Neighbourhood First Policy, introduced by the Modi government in 2014, can be seen as an evolution of the Gujral Doctrine. While it incorporates elements of reciprocity and strategic interest, it retains the emphasis on prioritizing relations with neighboring countries.
   - **Regional Stability**: The Gujral Doctrine contributed to regional stability by reducing tensions and promoting dialogue in South Asia, even if its direct impact was limited by geopolitical realities.

**7. Conclusion:**
   - **Visionary Approach**: The Gujral Doctrine was a visionary approach to foreign policy that sought to redefine India’s relations with its neighbors based on goodwill, mutual respect, and cooperation.
   - **Mixed Results**: While the doctrine had mixed results in terms of its immediate impact, its principles continue to resonate in India’s approach to regional diplomacy.
   - **Enduring Relevance**: The ideas of non-reciprocity, respect for sovereignty, and peaceful resolution of disputes remain relevant in contemporary international relations, especially in the context of South Asia’s complex geopolitical landscape.
