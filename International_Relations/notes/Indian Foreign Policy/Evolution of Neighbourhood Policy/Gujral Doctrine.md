### Gujral Doctrine: A Comprehensive Explanation

The **Gujral Doctrine** is a set of five principles formulated by **Inder Kumar Gujral**, who served as India’s Prime Minister from April 1997 to March 1998. This doctrine emerged during his tenure as India's External Affairs Minister in the mid-1990s and later, during his term as Prime Minister. It primarily guided India's foreign policy towards its immediate neighbors in South Asia.

### Historical Background:
India’s geopolitical position in South Asia places it at the center of relationships with several smaller neighboring countries. Historically, these relationships were often strained due to various political, economic, and security concerns. India's size, population, and economic and military power compared to its neighbors led to tensions where the smaller countries often felt overpowered or overshadowed by India.

Gujral, recognizing these challenges, aimed to improve diplomatic relations with these neighboring nations by reducing India’s perceived "big brother" attitude and promoting cooperation based on mutual trust, non-reciprocity, and non-interference. His approach emphasized building a peaceful and cooperative neighborhood without expecting immediate reciprocity from the neighbors, reflecting a shift in how India approached regional diplomacy.

### The Five Principles of Gujral Doctrine:

1. **Respect for Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity**:
   - India should not interfere in the internal affairs of its neighboring countries. This principle meant respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all South Asian countries.
   
2. **Non-Reciprocity**:
   - India, as the larger and more powerful country, should give concessions to its smaller neighbors without expecting anything in return. This principle of non-reciprocity was designed to show goodwill and remove the perception that India was seeking to dominate or control its neighbors.

3. **No Interference in Internal Affairs**:
   - The doctrine stressed non-interference in the domestic affairs of neighboring countries. This was aimed at building trust and respect in the region. For example, India would refrain from intervening in political issues within its neighbors unless there was a clear threat to India’s security.

4. **Peaceful Coexistence**:
   - The Gujral Doctrine emphasized peaceful coexistence, seeking to establish an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding, avoiding conflict or aggressive policies.

5. **Resolution of Disputes through Peaceful Negotiation**:
   - India should resolve any disputes with its neighbors through dialogue and peaceful means, rather than through coercion or military power. This was meant to promote regional stability and cooperation.

### Application of the Gujral Doctrine:

1. **Bangladesh**:
   - Under the Gujral Doctrine, India worked on resolving long-standing issues with Bangladesh, including border disputes and sharing of river waters. India took steps to improve trade relations and cultural exchanges without demanding immediate reciprocal actions from Bangladesh.

2. **Nepal**:
   - India sought to improve relations with Nepal by focusing on cooperation in areas like trade, security, and development. The doctrine helped soften India’s image, particularly after previous tensions over border disputes and other political matters.

3. **Sri Lanka**:
   - India promoted peace in Sri Lanka by supporting diplomatic solutions to the civil war (Tamil issue) rather than direct military intervention. This demonstrated India’s desire to resolve regional conflicts through dialogue.

4. **Bhutan and the Maldives**:
   - Relations with Bhutan and the Maldives were generally stable, but the Gujral Doctrine reinforced India's approach of respecting the independence and sovereignty of these smaller states.

5. **Pakistan**:
   - Although relations with Pakistan remained complex due to the Kashmir conflict and other issues, the Gujral Doctrine influenced attempts to promote dialogue over military confrontation. The doctrine laid the groundwork for future diplomatic engagements.

### Impact and Legacy of the Gujral Doctrine:

1. **Strengthening Regional Diplomacy**:
   - The Gujral Doctrine led to improved relations between India and several of its neighbors, particularly Bangladesh and Nepal. India was seen as a more cooperative partner, ready to engage in dialogue and resolve disputes peacefully.

2. **Trust-Building**:
   - By offering concessions without expecting immediate returns, India was able to build greater trust with its neighbors. This was especially important in reducing the perception that India sought to dominate the region.

3. **Long-Term Influence on Indian Foreign Policy**:
   - Though Gujral’s tenure as Prime Minister was brief, the principles of his doctrine have influenced Indian foreign policy in the years since. Later governments have continued to emphasize diplomacy, dialogue, and non-interference in the region.

4. **Limitations**:
   - The doctrine had limitations, particularly with regard to Pakistan. Due to the deep-rooted conflicts over Kashmir and cross-border terrorism, relations with Pakistan remained strained. However, the doctrine did open up diplomatic channels for future dialogue.

### Conclusion:

The Gujral Doctrine was a visionary approach that aimed to create a more peaceful and cooperative neighborhood for India. It shifted India's foreign policy from being perceived as a regional hegemon to that of a cooperative partner. Though its implementation had mixed success, especially with Pakistan, the doctrine laid the groundwork for improved relations with other neighbors like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.
