### **Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP)**

The **Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP)** is a critical policy initiative designed to channelize funds and resources for the social and economic upliftment of Scheduled Castes (SCs). Introduced in 1979, the SCSP aims to ensure that a certain percentage of the total plan budget is earmarked for schemes and programs benefiting SC communities. It is a strategic effort by the government to address the historical marginalization and deprivation faced by SCs through targeted development interventions.

   - The percentage of funds allocated under SCSP should be equivalent to the percentage of SC population in the country or the respective state.

2. **Focused Development**:
   - SCSP ensures that funds are used exclusively for programs that directly benefit **Scheduled Castes** in areas like **education**, **employment**, **housing**, **healthcare**, and **livelihoods**.

3. **Elimination of Poverty and Economic Empowerment**:
   - A significant focus of SCSP is to eradicate **poverty** among SCs through income generation programs, skill development, and employment opportunities.
   - The Sub-Plan supports initiatives that promote **entrepreneurship** and **self-employment** among SCs, thus enhancing their economic status.

   - The Constitution mandates the state to promote the **educational and economic interests of SCs** through **Article 46**, which is a part of the **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs)**.
   - Article 46 directs the state to take **special care** of the SCs and protect them from **social injustice** and **all forms of exploitation**.

2. **Article 275**:
   - Under **Article 275**, the Constitution provides for **grants-in-aid** from the Union government to the states for promoting the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Tribes. These grants are crucial for funding SCSP initiatives.
